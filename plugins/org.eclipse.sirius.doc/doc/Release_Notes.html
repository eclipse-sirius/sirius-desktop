		<h2 id="sirius5.1.0">Changes in Sirius 5.1.0</h2>
		<h3 id="UserVisibleChanges">User-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> When exporting a diagram as an image, it is now possible to choose whether or not the diagram should be scaled. If disabled, the diagram will be exported with its normal size (equivalent to a 100% zoom level). If auto-scaling is enabled, the diagram will be scaled to the maximum size safely allowed by the system (this can be different on different OSes). Note that when auto-scaling is enabled, the image files produced may be larger than without. When exporting very large diagrams it is also possible that the diagram will be scaled 
				<em>down</em> (i.e. with a zoom level smaller than 100%). Enabling auto-scaling can be chosen on a case by case basis from the export dialog; the initial value in the dialog can be controlled by a new preference available in the 
				<em>Sirius &gt; Sirius Diagram</em> preference page.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The end user can now 
				<a href="user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#RemoveBendpoints">remove all bend-points</a> on rectilinear edges. It was only possible on oblique edges before. This action is available on edge context menu &#8220;Remove Bend-points&#8221; or by using the shortcut &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; + &#8220;Shift&#8221; + &#8220;-&#8221;. If number of bend-points can not be reduced, remove action will be inefficient.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The status Synchronized/Unsynchronized of the diagram is now displayed in the status bar when the diagram editor has the focus or can be directly displayed 
				<a href="user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#synchronized_diagram">in the diagram</a> with a decorator.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The user now have a drop down menu in the tabbar with all available straighten to edge actions. </li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Straighten to actions on edge are now available even if the selection contains incompatible elements (edge labels for example). Their execution affects only compatible edges.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Four new straighten actions are available (with top pinned, with bottom pinned, with left pinned, with right pinned) and allow to straighten edges from the opposed straightening axis point of view.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a diagram, when selecting an edge or a node that are not fully displayed in the editor, now, the reveal is not done anymore, that is, the displayed content of the editor is not moved anymore. If the user want to fully see the selected element, he may drag the editor content using center mouse button. </li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a diagram with 
				<em>snapToGrid</em> enabled:
				<ul>
					<li>When performing a drag and drop from the model explorer or a palette tool to the diagram, the new created element is now snapped to the grid.</li>
					<li>When performing an 
						<em>Arrange all</em> or an 
						<em>Arrange Linked Border Node</em> action, all diagram elements are now snapped to the grid.
					</li>
					<li>When performing a drag and drop or a tool that will create multiple elements, all created elements are still visible but now snapped to the grid. </li>
					<li>When creating an edge with a tool that also create the associated border nodes, the border nodes are now snapped near the click location. Before, they were created to respect a shortest path.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./images/borderNodesWithSnapToGrid.png"/> 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a sequence diagram, it is now possible to resize the combined fragment when the first or the last operand is selected (increase the size of the first operand to the top, or increase the size of the last operand to the bottom). Before, it was necessary to select the combined fragment itself to resize it. </li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a sequence diagram, it is now possible to resize an 
				<em>Execution</em> contained in an 
				<em>Operand</em> without previously resize its 
				<em>Operand</em> if more space is needed. The 
				<em>Operand</em>, and if necessary the 
				<em>Combined Fragment</em>, is resized too.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a diagram, the action 
				<em>Show/Hide label</em> is now visible even if the selection contains invalid elements (ie elements without label). The action is applied only on valid elements of the selection.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In a diagram, the Line Style actions (Tree, Oblique or Rectilinear Routing Style) is now visible in the contextual menu even if the selection contains invalid elements (other elements than edges). The action is applied only on valid elements of the selection.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> When an user defines a custom bundled image shape for a figure (
				<a href="developer/extensions-provide_custom_bundled_image_shape.html#bundleImageShape">bundleImageShape</a> ), opening or refreshing a diagram will not display exception anymore when the bundleImageShape extension is not valid. A warning is now displayed in the Error Log view to inform user of which attribute of the extension is not correct.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="SpecifierVisibleChanges">Specifier-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> An 
				<a href="./user/general/Modeling%20Project.html#Migration">automatic migration</a> has been added in this version to fix diagram with edge labels corrupted (see 
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518870">bugzilla #518870</a> for more details). Contrary to all previous migrations, this one logs an information in the 
				<em>Error Log</em> view to inform how many labels have been fixed in concerned diagrams. If detected as &#8220;corrupted label&#8221;, the label is reset to its default location (as if you launch the &#8220;Snap Back&#8221; action of it). If at least one label is detected as &#8220;corrupted label&#8221;, the layout is also potentially corrupted (nodes, children of the diagram, with x or y coordinate very big). In this case, the concerned nodes are moved near 5000 (or -5000) as new coordinate. A message is added in this case: 
				<em>Some nodes have also been moved as the layout of this diagram is corrupted. A Reset Origin and/or manual layout is probably needed for this diagram.</em> The rules applied to detect a corrupted label are the following:
				<ul>
					<li>If the label is less than 250 pixels away from the reference point on its corresponding edge, the label is not considered as distant.</li>
					<li>If the label is more than 1000 pixels away from the reference point on its corresponding edge, the label is considered as distant.</li>
					<li>Between these 2 limits, the label is considered as distant if the distance between the center of the label and the edge is higher than &#8220;four times the size of the nearest segment&#8221;.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In manual refresh mode (
				<em>Automatic Refresh</em> Sirius preference disabled), when the 
				<em>Force Refresh</em> option of a tool is enabled in your VSM, only the current representation is refreshed when the tool is applied. Before this version, all open representations were refreshed.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The filtering expression variables available in the properties view definition in the &#8216;Extends&#8217; tab were renamed to match the following pattern: featureName+&#8216;Description&#8217;.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<em>Reference Name</em> field of 
				<em>Create instance</em> completion will display only features with a consistent type with the one specified in 
				<em>Type Name</em> field (if a type has been specified).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<em>Type Name</em> field of 
				<em>Create instance</em> completion will display only types consistent with the feature type specified in 
				<em>Reference Name</em> field (if a valid feature has been specified).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="DeveloperVisibleChanges">Developer-Visible Changes</h3>
		<h4 id="Migrations">Migrations</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A migration has been added to fix diagram with edge labels corrupted (see 
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=518870">bugzilla #518870</a> for more details). The corresponding version, stored in attribute version of viewpoint:DAnalysis of the aird file, is 
				<em>12.1.0.201706291600</em>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.gmf.runtime.gef.ui.figures.SiriusDefaultSizeNodeFigure</code> has been added in plugin 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.gmf.runtime</code>. The goal of the class is to workaround a 
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=519250">GMF bug</a>. So if you have created class which inherits from 
				<code>org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.gef.ui.figures.DefaultSizeNodeFigure</code>, you must now use the new 
				<code>SiriusDefaultSizeNodeFigure</code> instead.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A migration has been added to add an 
				<code>uid</code> to all instances of type DRepresentation. This 
				<code>uid</code> is used to reference the DRepresentation from the DRepresentationDescriptor. 
				<code>DRepresentationDescriptor.repPath</code> has been changed to have 
				<code>uid</code> as fragment. The corresponding version, stored in attribute version of viewpoint:DAnalysis of the aird file, is 
				<em>12.1.0.201707281200</em>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A migration has been added to fix diagram with edge bend-points corrupted (see 
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=519044">bugzilla #519044</a> for more details). The corresponding version, stored in attribute version of viewpoint:DAnalysis of the aird file, is 
				<em>12.1.0.201708031200</em>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="TranslationKeysChanges">Translation Keys Changes</h4>
		<p>See 
			<a href="i18n_changes.html#sirius51">this document</a> for the complete list of message keys added or removed in Sirius 5.0.
		</p>
		<h4 id="replazyloading">Representations lazy loading (experimental).</h4>
		<p>A new mode (currently experimental) is available to load representations on demand and not during session opening. This feature implies to serialize Sirius representations in separate resources. This mode can be activated by setting the system property 
			<code>createLocalRepresentationInSeparateResource</code> at true. For more detail, see the developer documentation: 
			<a href="./developer/representations_lazy_loading.html">Representations lazy loading (experimental)</a>.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Changesinorg.eclipse.sirius">Changes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius</code>
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new convenience static method has been added on the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.Session</code> interface to retrieve the session an arbitrary 
				<code>EObject</code> is part of: 
				<code>Optional&lt;Session&gt; s = Session.of(myObject);</code>. It returns a 
				<code>java.util.Optional&lt;Session&gt;</code> so all the usual patterns apply, e.g. 
				<code>Session.of(obj).ifPresent(s -&gt; doSomething(s));</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.viewpoint.DRepresentationDescriptor.isLoadedRepresentation()</code> has been added to know if the representation linked with this {@link DRepresentationDescriptor} is loaded. By default, all representations are held in the same resource than the DRepresentationDescriptor, in that case the method will always return true.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.danalysis.DAnalysisSession.allAnalyses()</code> has been added in the interface to reflect the already existing 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.internal.session.danalysis.DAnalysisSessionImpl.allAnalyses()</code> implementation.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectManager.getLoadedRepresentations(EObject, Session)</code> has been added to get all loaded representations in the given session with the given EObject as target.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectServices.getAllLoadedRepresentations(Session)</code> has been added to get all loaded representations in the given session.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.helper.SiriusUtil.REPRESENTATIONS_FOLDER_NAME</code> constant has been added. This is the default folder where representations file (*.srm) are located if the system property &#8220;createLocalRepresentationInSeparateResource&#8221; is set at true.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.tools.api.command.ui.UICallBack.shouldDeleteRepresentation(Set&lt;DRepresentationDescriptor&gt;)</code> has been added to be called when the user interface should prompt for a choice about the representation deletion.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> (experimental) The new API 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.SiriusReferenceFinder</code> and 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.EObjectQuery.getSiriusReferenceFinder()</code> method to get it have been added. This API allows getting the DRepresentations or DRepresentationElements that reference the provided semantic object. It also allows getting the DRepresentationDescriptor which associated DRepresentation is or contains elements that reference the provided semantic object. This API will be useful for 
				<a href="#replazyloading">representation lazy loading</a> as it may, in the future, not need to load all not yet loaded representations. For now, the use of this API will load all not loaded representations.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-danger">Removed</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectServices.getRepresentationDescriptors(EObject, Session)</code> has been moved to

			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.WorkspaceUtil.getFilesFromWorkspace(Collection&lt;IProject&gt;, String)</code> signature has been modified in

		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new query has been added in 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.business.api.query.DDiagramQuery</code>. This query, 
				<code>getAllActivatedLayers</code>, returns all the activated layers (transient or not) of the given diagram. It should replace 
				<code>DDiagram.getActivatedLayers</code> in several cases if you directly use it.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="Changesinorg.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui">Changes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code>
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Three new preferences have been added to 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.api.preferences.SiriusDiagramUiPreferencesKeys</code>: 
				<code>PREF_SCALE_DIAGRAMS_ON_EXPORT</code>, 
				<code>PREF_MAXIMUM_EXPORT_BUFFER_SIZE</code>, 
				<code>PREF_MAXIMUM_EXPORT_BUFFER_SIZE_WINDOWS</code>. They are used to control the auto-scaling behavior when exporting diagrams. Refer to the JavaDoc for the details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.api.part.DiagramEditPartService</code>, two new methods have been added:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>setAllowDownScaling(boolean)</code>: when auto-scaling is enabled (which is controlled by the already existing 
						<code>setAutoScalingEnabled()</code>), this is used to control if down-scaling is allowed or not. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>getScalingFactor()</code>: after the export has been performed, this can be used to obtain the scaling factor that was effectively used.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.business.api.DiagramExportResult</code> has been added, which inherits from 
				<code>ExportResult</code>. It is returned by the 
				<code>DialectManager.exportWithResult()</code> methods when the representation exported is a diagram, and in addition to the information provided by 
				<code>ExportResult</code> gives access to the scaling factor that was used when exporting the diagram.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The new preference

			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf.edit.EditingDomainServices</code> does not use 
				<code>Collection</code> anymore as return type or parameter type in its services. 
				<code>java.util.Collection</code> has been replaced by 
				<code>java.util.List</code>. As mentioned in the 
				<a href="./specifier/general/Writing_Queries.html#service_methods">specifier documentation</a>, it is recommended to use List or Set instead of Collection in java services signature.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="Changesinorg.eclipse.sirius.ui">Changes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui</code>
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.dialogs.AbstractExportRepresentationsAsImagesDialog</code> a new method 
				<code>isAutoScaleDiagram()</code> has been added to indicate (once the dialog has been closed) if the user has requested to enable auto-scaling on diagram export. 
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.actions.export.ExportAction</code>, a new method 
				<code>setAutoScaleDiagram(boolean)</code> to ask for automatic scaling of diagrams on export.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.business.api.dialect.DialectUIServices</code>, two new methods 
				<code>exportWithResult()</code> have been added. They are equivalent to the existing 
				<code>export()</code> methods (which return 
				<code>void</code>) except that they return an instance of the new type 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.business.api.dialect.ExportResult</code>. This gives access to the list of all the actual files produced by the export operation. Note that in the case of the diagram dialect, 
				<code>exportWithResult()</code> actually returns a more specific 
				<code>DiagramExportResult</code> with additional diagram-specific information.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The type 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.business.api.dialect.ExportFormat</code> has a new attribute representing the scaling policy to use for diagram. It is defined by a new enumerated type 
				<code>ExportFormat.ScalingPolicy</code> which can have four different values: 
				<code>WORKSPACE_DEFAULT</code>, 
				<code>AUTO_SCALING</code>, 
				<code>NO_SCALING</code>, 
				<code>AUTO_SCALING_IF_LARGER</code>. Refer to the JavaDoc for details on their meanings.

			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.wizards.CreateEMFModelWizard</code> is a new wizard that can be invoked to create instances of any metamodel. It will ask the end-user for a metamodel (
				<code>EPackage</code>), a concrete type to instanciate as root element, and finally the local path of the file to create. See the class Javadoc for sample usage. Note that the first two pages of the wizard (EPackage and root type selection) can be customized through the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.package_meta_data</code> extension point to provide user-oriented name and documentation for an EPackage, and to suggest specific EClasses as good root candidates.

			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.command.AbstractSWTCallback.shouldDeleteRepresentation(Set&lt;DRepresentationDescriptor&gt;)</code> default implementation has been added to prompt the confirm dialog.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.business.api.session.SessionEditorInput.SessionEditorInput(URI, URI, String, Session)</code> has been added to provide the 
				<code>DRepresentationDescriptor</code> URI to retrieve the 
				<code>DRepresentation</code> from the 
				<code>DRepresentationDescriptor.getRepresentation()</code> method instead of performing a direct load.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.assist.TextContentProposalProvider.getSelectedElement() method is now protected instead of private to let sub-classes retrieving the selected element.</li>

		<h2 id="sirius5.0.1">Changes in Sirius 5.0.1</h2>
		<p>Sirius 5.0.1 is a maintenance release with only bugfixes and small tweaks to the UI of 
			<a href="user/general/Aird_Editor.html">the aird editor</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="sirius5.0.0">Changes in Sirius 5.0.0</h2>
		<h3 id="UserVisibleChanges2">User-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> An new 
				<em>aird editor</em> is available on 
				<em>.aird</em> files. It provides an alternative, form-based GUI to visualize and manipulate sirius sessions which is not tied to the Modeling perspective or Model Explorer view. See 
				<a href="user/general/Aird_Editor.html">the editor&#8217;s documentation</a> for more details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The label alignment of Notes from the Palette has been modified from Juno to Luna or newer versions of Eclipse. The label alignment had changed from 
				<em>TOP</em> &amp; 
				<em>CENTER</em> to 
				<em>MIDDLE</em> &amp; 
				<em>LEFT</em> (respectively). The initial alignment (
				<em>TOP</em> &amp; 
				<em>CENTER</em>) has been restored. This is done with an 
				<a href="./user/general/Modeling%20Project.html#Migration">automatic migration</a> of the aird file.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<em>Export diagram as images</em> action now adatps the output resolution based on the diagram size. This leads to better resolution for small to medium diagrams (and also bigger file) and to an operation which is no longer failing with out of memory errors in case of very big diagrams.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The &#8220;straighten to&#8221; actions previously had a limitation concerning overlap detection. This is no longer the case. The previous known limitation has been removed from the documentation (
				<i>In case of multi-selection, the overlap check is done in the current context of existing border nodes and not in the context of location of border nodes after each straighten edges.</i>).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> Decorators on diagram elements are drawn on top of other figures. If there is an overlap between a decorator of a figure A and another figure B that is over figure A, when user clicks on the decorator, the figure B is now selected (before it was the parent figure A).</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="SpecifierVisibleChanges2">Specifier-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> It is now possible to automatically create one or several pre-configured widget(s) in a group if its domain class and if the meta-models of the properties view containing it have been specified. The widget(s) created will be infered from the features in the domain class (e.g. a properly configured 
				<em>Checkbox</em> widget will be created for boolean attributes).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Property Views definitions now support extending and overriding Properties View Descriptions without modifying the original. See 
				<a href="specifier/properties/Properties_View_Description.html#extensibility_features">the documentation</a> for details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> New model operations are available. You can now open a 
				<a href="specifier/general/Model_Operations.html#dialog">dialog</a> or a 
				<a href="specifier/general/Model_Operations.html#wizard">wizard</a> thanks to new dedicated model operations leveraging the Properties View language. You can also create new variable with the new 
				<em>Let</em> model operation, see its 
				<a href="specifier/general/Model_Operations.html#let">documentation</a> for more details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In Property Views definitions, you can now create 
				<em>Toolbar Actions</em> on pages and groups in order to define small buttons in their toolbars.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<em>Buttons</em> and 
				<em>Widget Actions</em> can now use an image along with a label thanks to the new 
				<em>Image expression</em>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> It is now possible to execute some behavior when the end users will click on the 
				<em>Reference Widget</em> thanks to the addition of an 
				<em>Initial Operation</em>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> You can indicate that a 
				<em>Dynamic Mapping For</em> should force the refresh of the user interface with the 
				<em>Force Refresh</em> property.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<em>Categories</em> have been added in order to organize the pages and groups of the 
				<em>Properties</em> DSL.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The notion of transient layer has been introduced in Sirius 5.0. (Refer to 
				<a href="specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#Transientlayer">Sirius Specifier</a> and 
				<a href="user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#transientLayer">Sirius User</a> documentation in Diagram chapter). A transient layer is an additional layer containing only decorations or tools. If you have such layer in your VSM, users may encounter some unexpected behaviors. If the layer is not 
				<em>active by default</em>, its activation state will not be persisted at session close. In other words, if a transient layer is enabled in a diagram and then the session is closed, at the next diagram opening, the layer will be disabled. If users have existing representations file, made with previous version, with such kind of layers activated, they will no longer enabled at the next opening in Sirius 5.0.0. If the layer is 
				<em>active by default</em> then it will be automatically applied when opening your diagram. We consider this behavior as a known limitation and an enhancement may be done in a further release. In the meantime, there is a workaround which consists to add a fake mapping (that is any mapping with its fields empty) so that the layer will not be considered as transient.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The tab used to configure the metamodels used by the Properties view description is now using the same interface as the metamodels tab used to configure the representations.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>package::Class</code> syntax for domain classes and type names in the VSM is now fully supported and the new default. It means this syntax is interpreted by Sirius and completion is provided for it when the first 
				<code>:</code> character is entered. The legacy syntax 
				<code>package.Class</code> is still supported for compatibility.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The organization of the contextual actions in the odesign for the 
				<em>Properties</em> DSL has been improved.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> Most of the concepts of the 
				<em>Properties</em> DSL can now have an identifier, a label and some documentation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="DeveloperVisibleChanges2">Developer-Visible Changes</h3>
		<h4 id="Migrations2">Migrations</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A migration is added in this version to fix the alignment of the text in notes (as explained in user visible changes). The corresponding version, stored in attribute version of viewpoint:DAnalysis of the aird file, is 
				<em>12.0.0.201704070000</em>.

				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl.isIncluded(EReference)</code> has been overridden to consider features in the white list.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new extension point, 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.package_meta_data</code> has been added. It can be used to associate user-oriented meta-data to Ecore metamodels, identified by their 
				<code>nsURI</code>: a user-oriented name/label (as opposed to the technical nsURI), a (short) description/documentation, and a list of suggested EClasses defined in the EPackage that are good candidates as root model elements. These meta-data are currently used only in the generic model creation wizard integrated in the aird editor.

		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> An experimental mode to serialize representations in a different file is available with system property

			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectServices.canCreate(EObject, RepresentationDescription, boolean)</code> has been added to better control the checks done by already existing 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectServices.canCreate(EObject, RepresentationDescription)</code> method. The new boolean allow to deactivate the check verifying that the viewpoint of the given description must be activated so the method can return true.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.viewpoint.description.DAnnotation.references</code> feature has been added. It allows to have some information without having to search them into the entire model of the Sirius session. Ideally only elements from semantic resources of the session should be referenced or else it may broke the session behavior either because resolving too soon EObject in the session or because adding a resource that is not known by Sirius session.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span>

				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.viewpoint.DRepresentationDescriptor.updateRepresentation(DRepresentation)</code> instead.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.viewpoint.DRepresentationDescriptor.updateRepresentation(DRepresentation)</code> has been added to update the repPath attribute according to the given representation. This method is intended to be called if the representation instance is still the same but requires to recompute the repPath.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span>

				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code> plugin. This leads to a noticeable increase of the export image size (you can expect a 10 factor on small diagrams) and the method will no longer fail with OutOfMemory errors as bigger diagrams will lead to a lower output resolution. Implementers using this class can override the

				<code>DRepresentation</code> must be reworked. The code using methods in the following list may be concerned by the rework:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>EObject.eContainer()</code>. If the object is a 
						<code>DRepresentation</code>, its container is now null.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>EcoreUtil.getRootContainer(xxx)</code>. The root container of a DDiagramElement is the 
						<code>DRepresentation</code> and not the 
						<code>DAnalysis</code> any more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>EcoreUtil.isAncestor(xxx)</code>. the 
						<code>DView</code> is not an ancestor of a 
						<code>DRepresentation</code> (or its content) anymore.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> As a developer, the followings utility methods will help you to migrate your code following the second step described above:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.DViewQuery.getLoadedRepresentations()</code> replaces the removed 
						<code>DView.getOwnedRepresentations()</code> method. It provides all the loaded representations holds by a 
						<code>DView</code>. In this step, all that representations are always loaded as they are into the .aird resource.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.DViewQuery.getAllContentInRepresentations(final Predicate&lt;? super EObject&gt;)</code> provides the content of a 
						<code>DView</code> according to a predicate.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.DRepresentationQuery.getRepresentationDescriptor()</code> provides the 
						<code>DRepresentationDescriptor</code> which references the 
						<code>DRepresentation</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.EObjectQuery.getDAnalysis()</code> allows to retrieve a DAnalysis from a

		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Sirius 4.0 introduces 
				<strong>experimental</strong> support for specifying the properties views of your modelers directly from inside the VSM. This feature uses the same dynamic approach as for specifying diagrams, tables and trees, with a very flexible configuration language and no code generation involved (including live preview of any change). As of Sirius 4.0, this feature should be considered in an experimental state with details subject to changes until Sirius 4.1, and is not installed by default. To install it, make sure either 
				<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon">the Eclipse Neon repositry</a> or the 
				<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/sirius/updates/releases/4.0.0/neon">Sirius 4.0</a> and 
				<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/eef/updates/releases/1.6.0">EEF 1.6</a> repositories are available, and then to install the following features (from in the 
				<em>Modeling</em> category of Neon, or 
				<em>Sirius Experimental Features</em> of the Sirius repository ):
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Sirius Properties Views &#8211; Runtime Support</em> (
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.properties.feature.feature.group</code>): needed at runtime for deployed modelers which have properties views defined in their specification.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Sirius Properties Views &#8211; Specifier Support</em> (
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.specifier.properties.feature.feature.group</code>): provides support for editing the configuration model directly inside the VSM editor and the specifier documentation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once this is done, you can find the actual documentation in the 
			<em>Sirius Specifier Manual</em>, under the 
			<a href="specifier/properties/Properties_View_Description.html">
				<em>Properties View</em>
			</a> section.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> All static strings defined in the VSMs which are visible to the end-user of the modeler, like viewpoint and tools names, can now be internationalized. Simply replace the name with a translation key reference of the form 
				<code>%myUniqueKey</code> in the VSM, and define the value in the 
				<em>Viewpoint Specification Project</em>'s 
				<code>plugin.properties</code> (for the default value), or 
				<code>plugin_XX.properties</code> for locale 
				<code>XX</code>. The underlying mechanism is the same as for Eclipse/OSGi plug-ins, so translations can even be contributed by physically separate plug-in fragments. See 
				<a href="specifier/general/Specifying_Viewpoints.html#translatable_messages">the corresponding section</a> in the documentation for more details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> It is possible to create 
				<a href="specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#filter_with_typed_variable">Typed Variable</a> under Variable Filter.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf.edit.EditingDomainServices</code> (from plug-in 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf.edit</code>) has been added with a complete set of service methods to leverage most of the features of the &#8220;EMF Edit&#8221; framework, for example the various 
				<em>Item Providers</em> associated to semantic elements. See 
				<a href="specifier/general/Writing_Queries.html#editing_domain_services">the documentation</a> for details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The specifier can now restrict the border node authorized sides. This new option is available in the advanced tab of the border node style. See the 
				<a href="specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#authorizedsides">specifier documentation</a> for more details.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The use of type literals in operations like 
				<code>filter()</code> or 
				<code>oclIsKindOf()</code> requires to explicitly add the domain meta-models plug-ins to the dependencies of the

				<strong>Warning</strong>: Before this version, a style customization of an 
				<code>EEnum</code> attribute, like 
				<code>labelFormat</code>, worked with a value expression using a Java service returning a 
				<code>EEnumLiteral</code>. It is now forbidden. You must return an 
				<code>Enumerator</code>. The documentation about 
				<a href="specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#enum_customization">Styles Customization</a> now details this case.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>BorderSizeComputationExpression</code> migration has been corrected to recursively handle the sub container mappings. VSM created or migrated with Sirius 3.1.0, 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 might require a manual modification for the style descriptions of sub container mappings with border size computation equals to 0 as we cannot determine if they were added (or updated) after or before the migration: starting with Sirius 3.1.0, no border will be displayed for a 0 pixel value whereas with older version container always had at least a 1 pixel border.
