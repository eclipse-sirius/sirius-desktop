		<p>This document contains the release notes for older versions of of Sirius.</p>
		<h2 id="sirius3.0.0">Changes in Sirius 3.0.0</h2>
		<h3 id="UserVisibleChanges">User-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The ability to print table representations has been re-introduced.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The quick outline feature has been added for tree and table editors, see documentation for details.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The label of a list or container can now be hidden by the user from the outline, the tabbar or the contextual menu.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In the 
				<em>Appearance</em> tab, in addition to 
				<em>Bold</em> and 
				<em>Italic</em>, it is now possible to set the font formatting style to 
				<em>Underline</em> and 
				<em>Strike through</em> (or any combination of these).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Container elements on diagrams now support vertical and horizontal compartments layout (this is only visible if the modeler configuration makes use of this new feature). </li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In table and tree editors, a 
				<em>Refresh</em> can now be launched by hitting <kbd>F5</kbd> like in diagrams (previously the only way was to click on the 
				<em>Refresh</em> icon or menu item).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In table editors, hitting the <kdb>Del</kdb> key is now equivalent to selecting 
				<em>Delete Line</em> in the context menu.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> On diagrams, it is now possible to set a custom background image on list containers.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In the 
				<em>Viewpoint Selection</em> dialog and wizard page, the &#8220;plug-in&#8221; decorator for viewpoints loaded from plug-ins is removed, and a &#8220;Folder&#8221; decorator for viewpoints loaded from the current workspace has been added. This makes the icons more visible in the most common where viewpoints come from installed plug-ins.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="SpecifierVisibleChanges">Specifier-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> <span class="label label-info">Experimental</span> Optional support for the experimental 
				<em>Acceleo Query Language</em> (AQL) has been added to write interpreted expressions.  It is provided by the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.acceleo.aql</code> (required for evaluating the expressions) and 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.acceleo.aql.ide</code>  (optional, only needed to provide specification-time features like expression completion) plug-ins. AQL is similar to Acceleo 3/MTL, but simpler and provides much better performance in the Sirius context. If you make use of this feature, be aware that some details may still change in future releases, including 3.0.x maintenance releases. See <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/documentation/aql.html" target="_blank">the AQL documentation</a> for more details on the language itself.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> <span class="label label-info">Experimental</span> New, experimental support for containers with vertical or horizontal 
				<em>compartments</em> on diagrams: the 
				<em>children presentation</em> property of a 
				<em>Container Mapping</em> has two new values: 
				<em>Vertical Stack</em> and 
				<em>Horizontal Stack</em>. They indicate that a container will present its children containers as a vertical/horizontal stack of compartments. While working reliably, this support is marked experimental in Sirius 3.0.0 as there are still some combinations of mappings, styles and behaviors which do not behave as expected. If you make use of this feature, be aware that some details may still change in future releases, including 3.0.x maintenance releases.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Everywhere an image path can be configured in the VSM, a new button is present on the right of the text field. It opens a dialog to select an image, either from the workspace or from an installed plug-in.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Everywhere an interpreted expression can be configured in the VSM, a new button is present on the right of the text field. It opens a multi-line dialog to edit long expression more easily. Auto-completion is supported inside the multi-line dialog.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Compressed SVG images (
				<code>*.svgz</code>) are now supported everywhere normal SVG images were supported.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> When developing a modeler in &#8220;live mode&#8221;, with the VSM in the same workspace as the sample session(s) which use it, VSM expressions which use 
				<code>service:</code> or 
				<code>aql:</code> can now invoke Java services which are defined in the workspace (with no need to launch a separate runtime).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A quick outline is now accessible in the VSM editor by using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+o</kbd>. It supports filtering on both an element&#8217;s name and properties for quick, keyboard-only navigation in complex VSMs.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The &#8220;hide label by default capability&#8221; has been added to the container styles.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> In addition to 
				<em>Bold</em> and 
				<em>Italic</em>, 
				<em>Underline</em> and 
				<em>Strike Through</em> styles have been added on the label font format.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Improved</span> Many VSM elements which are required are now created automatically. For example the default layer of a 
				<em>Diagram Description</em> is automatically added to new 
				<em>Diagram Descriptions</em>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Improved</span> Some default values have been modified to better reflect actual usage. This does not impact existing VSM and only applies to newly created elements.
				<ul>
					<li>The label position on a 
						<em>Node</em> mapping is now 
						<em>node</em> by default (instead of 
						<em>border</em> before).
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<em>Arc Width</em> and 
						<em>Arc Height</em> are now 10 by default (instead of 1 before).
					</li>
					<li>The 
						<em>Enable popup bars</em> is now set by default on new diagrams.
					</li>
					<li>No default value for interpreted expressions use the Acceleo 3 / MTL syntax anymore, but only use the core 
						<code>var:</code> and 
						<code>feature:</code> interpreters, which are always present.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Improved</span> The precision of the VSM validation, especially regarding the typing of computed expressions, has been greatly improved. Other validation rules like static image paths have also been added or improved.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In the VSM editor, the context menu entries (categories and items) have been reorganized to put most common actions/items first.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In diagrams, the style previously named &#8220;Lozenge&#8221; is now called &#8220;Diamond&#8221;.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> In the 
				<em>Open</em> menu on a representation, the menu is computed from the navigation tool&#8217;s label instead of its name/id.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> All Acceleo 3 references have been removed from the Sirius metamodels to avoid a dependency to Acceleo 3. An automatic migration has been added during the loading of the VSM to avoid a change of behavior. This migration adds explicitly the old default value (
				<code>[eContents()-&gt;size()/]</code>) in the VSM, that was implicit before. Customers who want to completely remove this dependency must remove the Acceleo 3 expressions from there VSM after the migration.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The default icons paths of 
				<em>Selection Wizard</em> and 
				<em>Pane-Based Selection Wizard</em> used to reference invalid icons, so the corresponding tools had no icon per default in the palette. The default icons paths have been corrected to reference the icons displayed for those elements in the VSM editor.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> "
				<code>*</code>" can now be used as feature name of a table&#8217;s 
				<em>Feature Column</em> to skip the feature name validation during the cell creation. This allow to compute the label of cells for lines whose semantic element types have no common 
				<em>EStructuralFeature</em> (inherited or with same name).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="DeveloperVisibleChanges">Developer-Visible Changes</h3>
		<p>The most important and impacting changes in this release are (details below in plug-in specific sections):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span>  The new extension point 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui.siriuspropertiescelleditor</code>, defined in 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui</code>, can be used to provide customized cell editors for semantic element&#8217;s properties as shown in the properties view on a Sirius representation.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span>  The new class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.eef.components.SiriusAwarePropertiesEditingComponent</code> can be used as root class of the generated EEF components to greatly improve performances when using both EEF properties views with Sirius representations. 
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The minimum version of EEF required for using 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.eef.adapters</code> is now 1.5.0 (from 1.2 before). EEF 1.5 is source and binary-compatible with EEF 1.2 to 1.4, and no re-generation of the EEF views should be needed to switch to 1.5.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.internal.session.IsModifiedSavingPolicy</code> saving policy, introduced in Sirius 2.0.0 but not enabled at that time is now the default. The previous implementation, 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.SavingPolicyImpl</code> is still available if needed.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> All metamodels defined by Sirius have been modified to use EMF&#8217;s 
				<code>MinimalEObjectImpl.Container</code> as base class, which reduces memory consumption compared to previous versions.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>RGBValues</code> type used in Sirius to represent colors has been converted into an immutable EMF EDataType, which also reduces memory consumption compared to previous versions.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>AirdResourceImpl</code> type, use for the 
				<code>*.aird</code> resources, no longer inherits from GMF&#8217;s 
				<code>GMFResource</code> or depend on GMF in any way. This makes the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius</code> now completely independent on GMF.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The 
				<code>DAnalsysis.models</code> reference has been replaced by the 
				<code>DAnalsysis.semanticModels</code> attribute, in conjunction with the new 
				<code>ResourceDescriptor</code> data-type. The 
				<code>DAnalysis.getModels()</code> Java method is still present for compatibility and returns the same values, but the returned list can not be modified. All changes must be made directly on 
				<code>DAnalsysis.semanticModels</code> and will be reflected in the value returned by 
				<code>DAnalysis.getModels()</code>. While not technically deprecated yet, 
				<code>DAnalysis.getModels()</code> should be avoided and may be removed in a future release.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Moved</span> Extensions in 
				<code>plugin.xml</code> that provide UI functionalities have been moved to new 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.*.ext</code> plug-ins, to make the contributions to the UI optional. If your product consumed directly the Sirius plug-ins instead of the high-level features, you may need to add the new plug-ins if you want the Sirius UI contributions to stay available.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-danger">Removed</span> Many unused types defined in the metamodels have been removed. This should not impact normal client code. Existing models will be automatically migrated on loading if needed.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-danger">Removed</span> Sirius no longer installs the 
				<code>AirDCrossReferenceAdapterImpl</code>, which was a subclass of GMF&#8217;s 
				<code>CrossReferenceAdapter</code> on session resources (
				<code>*.aird</code>). If your code relied on GMF&#8217;s implementation to find inverse references, it can use the Sirius session&#8217;s 
				<code>Session.getSemanticCrossReferencer()</code> instead, which provides the same service (and more) and avoids the redundant installation of GMF&#8217;s version.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Packaging changes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Two new feature have been added concerning the new support for the AQL language:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.runtime.aql</code> includes the minimum required to execute AQL queries at runtime. It must be present on end-users' systems for modelers which use AQL expressions to work.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>org.eclipse.sirius.aql</code> includes both the runtime requirements and the development-time features like support for auto-completion of AQL expressions in the VSM editor.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span>  The new feature 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.specifier</code> includes everything needed to have a complete Sirius specification environment, with support for all dialects. It includes support for Acceleo 3/MTL queries, but not for AQL (provided by 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.aql</code>) or OCL (provided by 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.runtime.ocl</code>). Future Sirius releases will probably swap AQL and Acceleo 3, making AQL the defaut and part of the main feature, and Acceleo 3/MTL optional in a separate feature.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> All Sirius releases and milestones are available as zipped archives in addition to a normal p2 repository/update-site. For each version and platform (e.g. 3.0.0 on Eclipse Mars), two archives are available: one with the Sirius core, and one with the Sirius automated test suites and the sample modelers they rely on. See the 
				<a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Sirius/Update_Sites">Sirius wiki</a> and release pages for more details and links to these archives, for example 
				<code>http://download.eclipse.org/sirius/updates/releases/2.0.5/</code>. This is retro-active on all previously released versions of Sirius, but not on milestones before 3.0.0.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other changes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Sirius now provides an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/oomph" target="_blank">Oomph</a> setup file to automatically create a fully configured Eclipse installation ready for contributing patches to Sirius. The latest version can be obtained <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/sirius/org.eclipse.sirius.git/plain/releng/org.eclipse.sirius.settings/Sirius.setup" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> New patches proposed by contributors on the <a href="https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/admin/projects/sirius/org.eclipse.sirius" target="_blank">Sirius Gerrit</a> now automatically trigger a sub-set of the Sirius automated test suites, which give a good feedback on the absence of regressions introduced by the proposed patch.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="Changesinorg.eclipse.sirius.common">Changes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common</code>
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter</code> interface and the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl</code> have been added to have the capability to disable the proxy resolution. This feature is typically used to prevent loading a resource during its unloading. 
				<strong>Warning</strong> : 
				<em>Every additional custom CrossReferenceAdapter</em>  should extend 
				<code>SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl</code> or at least implement 
				<code>SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter</code> with the same implementation as 
				<code>SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.ECrossReferenceAdapterWithUnproxyCapability</code> is a specific kind of 
				<code>SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter</code>. It provides the capability to resolve all proxy cross references to a given resource. It is now used by the Session as semantic cross referencer. This type is exposed as API but it is not intended to be used/referenced/extended by user code (as the below 
				<code>LazyCrossReferencer</code> type).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The static method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.ReflectionHelper.getFieldValueWithoutException(Class&lt;?&gt;, String)</code> has been added to return an internal static value of a class.   
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.resource.ResourceSetSync</code> has a new state 
				<code>CHANGES_CANCELED</code> used to define the state where the user canceled its changes.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.resource.ImageFileFormat</code> class has been added (it was in 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.swt</code> before).
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.EclipseUtil.getConfigurationElementsFor()</code> has been added: it calls 
				<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getExtensionRegistry().getConfigurationElementsFor()</code> only if 
				<code>Platform.isRunning()</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The interface 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.migration.IMigrationParticipant</code> exposes a new method 
				<code>postXMLEndElement([..])</code> which is called during a migration operation. This method should be overridden by participants which have to hook the loading process after each end of XML tag. The  corresponding abstract class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.migration.AbstractMigrationParticipant</code> provides a default empty  implementation.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.JavaExtensionsManager</code> can now be used by langages interpreters to benefit from a consistent handling of Java extensions and support for loading Java services from the workspace.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.TypeName</code> has been introduced to represent in the codebase any type which was previously represented as a plain String.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new interface 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.TypedValidation</code> has been introduced for 
				<code>IInterpreter</code> implementations able to provide richer information when validating an expression. This information is captured through a 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.ValidationResult</code> instance.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.VariableType</code> has been introduced to represent the possible types a variable can have in a Viewpoint specification model.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The utility class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IInterpreterContextUtils</code> has been introduced to factorize code related to managing 
				<code>IInterpreterContext</code> instances.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.description.MultiLanguagesValidator</code> has been introduced to provide a safe and more efficient way to switch to the proper 
				<code>IInterpreter</code> instance when validating expressions.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> <span class="label label-danger">Removed</span> The class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.RefreshIdFactory</code> has been replaced with 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.RefreshIdsHolder</code> which no longer rely on a global singleton but attach information to an EObject representing the current scope. This impacts 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.business.api.query.AbstractDNodeQuery</code> , 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.CartesianProduct</code> and 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.EObjectCouple</code> which are now requiring now a 
				<code>RefreshIdsHolder</code> instance.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span>
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.LazyCrossReferencer</code> now extends 
				<code>ECrossReferenceAdapterWithUnproxyCapability</code> and implements 
				<code>resolveProxyCrossReferences(Resource)</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Moved</span> The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.LazyCrossReferencer.enableResolve()</code>  and 
				<code>disableResolve()</code>  methods has been moved to 
				<code>SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter.enableResolveProxy()</code>  and 
				<code>disableResolveProxy()</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The static method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.DefaultInterpreterContextFactory.createInterpreterContext(...)</code> now requires a 
				<code>Map&lt;String, VariableType&gt;</code> for the accessible variables instead of a 
				<code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code>.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The methods 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IInterpreterContext.getVariables()</code>  and 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.description.IInterpretedExpressionQuery.getAvailableVariables()</code> are now returning a map containing 
				<code>VariableType</code> instances instead of encoded Strings.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-info">Modified</span> The method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IInterpreterStatus.getTargetTypes()</code> no longer returns a list of encoded Strings but a 
				<code>VariableType</code> instance instead.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-warning">Deprecated</span> The method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IInterpreterContext.getTargetTypes()</code> has been deprecated in favor of 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IInterpreterContext.getTargetType()</code> which returns a 
				<code>VariableType</code> instance instead of encoded Strings.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="Changesinorg.eclipse.sirius.common.ui">Changes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.ui</code>
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> Classes from 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.ui.tools.api.dialog.quickoutline</code> packages are available in API to allow editor to provide quick outline feature easily.
			</li>
			<li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> The methods 
				<code>displaySyncExec(Runnable)</code> , 
				<code>displayAsyncExec(Runnable)</code> and 
				<code>synchronizeWithUIThread()</code> have been added in class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.ui.tools.api.util.EclipseUIUtil</code> to encapsulate accesses to the current

		</p>
		<h2 id="sirius2.0.0">Changes in Sirius 2.0.0</h2>
		<h3 id="UserVisibleChanges2">User-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It is now possible to select element that intersects the selection rectangle and not that is completely contained by the selection rectangle. This new behavior is enabled when user selects elements from right to left. The normal mode (previous mode) remains when the user selects elements from left to right.</li>
			<li>The edges appearance is now kept, as much as possible, when one of its extremity is moved. A move of an extremity should move only the closest segment of the edge.</li>
			<li>The edges appearance is kept as much as possible when a node (container or not) is moved. A move of a node now impacts only the closest segment of the linked edges.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/moveNode-edgeImpact-changedBehavior.gif"/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When a node, container or not, is resized to the left, upwards, or both, the location of its children (elements inside a container and border nodes) is not changed. It is possible to retrieve the previous behavior by pressing the F3 function key during the resize.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/containerResize-changedBehavior.gif"/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The &#8220;snap to shapes&#8221; is now enabled by default (see  
				<em>Sirius &gt; Sirius Diagram &gt; Rulers and Grid</em> preference page). This is true only for new diagrams. The existing diagrams are not impacted.
			</li>
			<li>The &#8220;Navigate&#8221; top-level contextual menu entry with mixed actions for creating new representations and opening existing ones has been changed by two top-level menus:
				<ul>
					<li>One named &#8220;New&#8221;, which lists only the available actions to create new representations on the selected element.</li>
					<li>One named &#8220;Open&#8221;, which lists only the existing representations on the selected element. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When a shape is resized (no matter the direction), the edge(s) connection location (toward or from this one) is kept. Before that, edges connections moved according to the ratio of the resizing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Example with this initial state before resizing:
			<br/>
			<img border="0" src="images/shapeResize1.png"/>
			<br/>Result after resizing without this feature (the edges have moved):
			<br/>
			<img border="0" src="images/shapeResize2.png"/>
			<br/>Result after resizing with this feature (the edges keep the same location):
			<br/>
			<img border="0" src="images/shapeResize3.png"/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is now the possibility to distribute the selected shapes (see 
				<a href="user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#distribute">Sirius User Manual/Diagrams/Features Overview/Distribute elements</a> for more details):
				<ul>
					<li>Distribute gaps horizontally</li>
					<li>Distribute centers horizontally</li>
					<li>Distribute gaps vertically</li>
					<li>Distribute centers vertically</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The end user can now remove all bend-points between the two edge ends. This action is available on edge context menu &#8220;Remove Bend-points&#8221; or by using the shortcut &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; + &#8220;Shift&#8221; + &#8220;-&#8221;.</li>
			<li>Reconnection of an edge will only now move the minimum necessary bendpoints instead of reseting it to default.</li>
			<li>A new action has been added to reset the diagram (or container) origin: the diagram (or container) bounds (the rectangle formed by the highest, the leftmost, the lowest and the rightmost children elements) can have a negative origin or can be shifted toward the bottom-right with a blank zone at the top-left. This action aims to move all diagram (or container) elements so that the it retrieves its origin while keeping elements layout.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="SpecifierVisibleChanges2">Specifier-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The specifier can now choose to hold the edge ends toward the center of the source, target or both. New fields within the &#8220;advance&#8221; tab of EdgeStyle description have been added to choose for which source or target mappings an edge should be centered. See 
				<a href="specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#edges_styles">Edges Styles &gt; Edge Centering</a> in the specifier manual for more details.
			</li>
			<li>When creating a new Viewpoint Specification Project using the supplied wizard: 
				<em>New &gt; Viewpoint Specification Project</em>, the VSM name is now given according to the project name. If the project name is suffixed with &#8220;design&#8221;, the VSM name is provided by the last word before this suffix. Otherwise, the VSM name is given by the last word of the project name.
			</li>
			<li>&#8220;Lozenge&#8221; is replaced by &#8220;Diamond&#8221; in diagram style.</li>

			<li>
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.color.AbstractColorUpdater.DEFAULT_RED_VALUE/DEFAULT_GREEN_VALUE/DEFAULT_BLUE_VALUE</code> constants have been added to have access to default

				<code>ColorDescription</code>, for example in tree dialect where background color definition is optional.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.tool.ToolFilterDescriptionListener.ToolFilterDescriptionListener()</code> constructor now takes an 
				<code>IInterpreter</code> as additional parameter to capture the current interpreter and avoid calls to the 
				<code>IInterpreterRegistry</code> for each evaluation of the tool filter expressions.

			<li>
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.AirdResourceQuery.getAirDCrossReferenceAdapter()</code> and

		<p>This milestone (Sirius 1.0M7) includes the third, and final, step towards a full separation of the diagram-specific stuff out of the core of Sirius (see 
			<a href="#separationOfDiagramSpecificConcept-step1">Step1</a> and 
			<a href="#separationOfDiagramSpecificConcept-step2">Step2</a> for more details).
		</p>
		<p>All classes related to diagrams in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius</code> have been moved to 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram</code>.
			<br/>All classes related to diagrams in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ui</code> have been moved to 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code>.
			<br/>All classes related to diagrams in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.editor</code> have been moved to 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.editor.diagram</code>.
			<br/>In the same way, all classes related to UI in 
			<code>org.eclipse.diagram</code> have been moved to 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code>. To simplify this step almost all classes of 
			<code>org.eclipse.diagram</code> have been moved in 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code> (and probably not only UI classes). These classes have been moved in 
			<code>src-diag</code> source folder to facilitate future work about moving some of these classes in 
			<code>org.eclipse.diagram</code> again.
		</p>
		<p>Unlike, the 
			<a href="#separationOfDiagramSpecificConcept-step1">Step1</a>, a simple &#8220;Organize Imports&#8221; operation is not enough. First, you will probably need to add dependencies to 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram</code>, 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui</code> or 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.editor.diagram</code> in the MANIFEST.MF of your projects that depend on Sirius diagram classes. The dependencies to add depend on what you really use.

				<code>ViewpointRegistry.getDiagramDescriptionMappingsRegistry()</code> has been removed. You can now directly call 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.business.api.componentization.DiagramDescriptionMappingsRegistry.INSTANCE.DialectServices</code>.
			</li>
			<li>New methods have been added to 
				<code>IRepairParticipant</code> to isolate specific diagram repair steps.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>removeElements(DView, TransactionalEditingDomain, IProgressMonitor)</code>: Removes elements from the 
						<code>DView</code> that will be recreated by the refresh (called later).
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>cleanRepresentations(EList&lt;DRepresentation&gt;)</code>: Cleans representations (specific representation states like filters) and eventually returns some of them if they need to be removed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>refreshRepresentations(DAnalysis, DView)</code>: This method is only implemented by the diagram participant. To simplify work for this step, this method manages core and diagram elements. It should be clean up once the split will be done.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>To break the dependencies from Core to Diagram, several services have been added to:
				<ul>

							</li>
							<li>

							<li>
								<code>invalidateMappingCache()</code>: Allows each dialect to clean and compute again its proper mapping cache.
							</li>
							<li>
								<code>allowsEStructuralFeatureCustomization(EObject)</code>: allows dialects to indicate if they allow EStrucuralFeaturesCustomization for the given VSM element. It is currently supported for style descriptions in diagrams only.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>DialectUIServices</code>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<code>canHandle(RepresentationDescription)</code> and

								<code>completeToolTipText(String, EObject)</code> allows the dialect to customize the tooltip displayed in a property section of a given VSM element.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>DialectUIManager</code>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<code>canExport(DRepresentation, ExportFormat)</code>: New method returning true if at least one dialect is able to export this representation to this format, false otherwise.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>IDiagramDescriptionProvider</code>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<code>completeToolTipText(String, EObject)</code> allows the diagram type to customize the tooltip displayed in a property section of a given VSM element.

				<code>Map&lt;String, Collection&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> instead of a Guava-specific 
				<code>Multimap</code>. The new protected method 
				<code>addDefinition()</code> can be used to make it easier to add entries to the map. Subclasses in Sirius have been updated to match the new signature.
			</li>
			<li>The message 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.modelingproject.ModelingProject.ZERO_REPRESENTATIONS_FILE_FOUND_IN</code> has been removed without replacement. It was not really an API constant.
			</li>
			<li>The behavior of method 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.modelingproject.ModelingProject.getMainRepresentationsFileURI()</code> has changed. It now marks this project as invalid and adds a marker on it, if it is considered as invalid (no or many representations files).
			</li>
			<li>A new query 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.query.IFileQuery</code> has been added with a method to check if file is handled by an opened session, ie:
				<ul>
					<li>a semantic resource of this session,</li>
					<li>a referenced sub representations file,</li>
					<li>a controlled resource.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<code>EObjectLink</code> class has been removed from the metamodel. It was not used anywhere.
			</li>
			<li>In interface 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.description.IInterpretedExpressionTargetSwitch</code>, the 
				<code>getFirstRelevantContainerFinder()</code> method which returned a Guava 
				<code>Function&lt;EObject, EObject&gt;</code> has been replaced with the new method 
				<code>getFirstRelevantContainer(EObject)</code> which directly returns the result of applying the previously returned function. All implementers in Sirius itself have been updated.
			</li>
			<li>The constructor 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.description.DefaultInterpretedExpressionTargetSwitch(EStructuralFeature, IInterpretedExpressionTargetSwitch, Function&lt;EObject, EObject&gt;)</code> has been removed to avoid exposing a the Guava-specific 
				<code>Predicate</code> type. Sub-classes which used it with a non-null 
				<code>Function</code> should override the 
				<code>getFirstRelevantContainer(EObject)</code> method to return the result of that function instead.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.helper.task.AbstractDeleteDRepresentationElementTask</code> constructor which took a Guava 
				<code>Predicate&lt;EReference&gt;</code> now takes an equivalent 
				<code>EReferencePredicate</code> (from

			</li>
			<li>The constants 
				<code>DSEMANTICDECORATOR_REFERENCE_TO_IGNORE_PREDICATE</code> and 
				<code>NOTATION_VIEW_ELEMENT_REFERENCE_TO_IGNORE_PREDICATE</code> from 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.internal.session.danalysis.DanglingRefRemovalTrigger</code> are now instances of 
				<code>EReferencePredicate</code> instead of Guava&#8217;s 
				<code>Predicate&lt;EReference&gt;</code>.
			</li>
			<li>In class 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.SessionEventBroker</code>, the method 
				<code>addlLocalTrigger()</code> now takes a 
				<code>org.eclipse.emf.transaction.NotificationFilter</code> instead of a Guava-specific 
				<code>Predicate&lt;Notification&gt;</code> as first argument.
			</li>
			<li>The constant 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.tools.api.ui.RefreshEditorsPrecommitListener.IS_IMPACTING</code> is now a 
				<code>NotificationFilter</code> instead of a 
				<code>Predicate</code>, to match the API change in 
				<code>SessionEventBroker.addLocalTrigger()</code>.
			</li>
			<li>The 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.Session</code> interface has a new 
				<code>getSavingPolicy()</code> method which gives access to the currently configured saving policy.

		<h4 id="tests">High-level API for Automated Tests Using JUnit and SWTBot</h4>
		<p>Starting from version 1.0.0M6, Sirius includes high-level APIs to help creating automated tests using JUnit and/or SWTBot. These can be used either to test Sirius itself or to test Sirius-based modelers. These APIs are provided by two plug-ins:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.tests.support</code>: support code for JUnit (plug-in) tests using Sirius.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support</code>: support code for SWTBot tests using Sirius.
			</li>

		<p>This milestone (Sirius 1.0M6) includes the second step towards a full separation of the diagram-specific stuff out of the core of Sirius (see 
			<a href="#separationOfDiagramSpecificConcept-step1">Step1</a> for more details).
		</p>
		<p>This step is less impactful on your code than the first step. Nevertheless, some missed classes during first step have moved during this step:</p>
		<ul>

				<code>DDiagramSet</code> and its corresponding reference from 
				<code>DRepresentationContainer</code>: No longer needed
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>DragAndDropTarget</code>, 
				<code>DragAndDropTargetDescription</code> and 
				<code>ContainerDropDescription</code> have been moved to diagram EPackage.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint/diagram/description/validation</code> EPackage has been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/description/validation</code>: revert what was done in step 1 by mistake.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The existing VSM (

		</ul>
		<h3 id="APIChanges5">API Changes</h3>
		<h4 id="LibraryExtensions">Library Extensions</h4>
		<p>This milestone (Sirius 1.0M5) introduces several new plug-ins, collectively called &#8220;library extensions&#8221;. They are all named 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.ext.LIB</code>, where 
			<code>LIB</code> is the name of a library or component Sirius depends on. These plug-ins are used to isolate generic code which extends existing libraries with features and helpers needed for Sirius, but which do not depend on Sirius themselves. A relatively large part of the code in Sirius is of this kind: things that could/should be in EMF, GMF, Eclipse itself, etc. and which are not Sirius-specific but which make it easier to build Sirius itself. Sirius 1.0M5 introduces several of these library extensions and starts to fill them with existing classes which were &#8220;hidden&#8221; inside Sirius and are now exposed in library extensions. Most of the time, existing code which used the Sirius API will only need to:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the necessary 
				<code>Import-Package</code> (recommended) or 
				<code>Require-Bundle</code> to depend on the library extension(s) where the code they use now lives;
			</li>
			<li>Perform a simple &#8220;Organize Imports&#8221; operation, which should find the classes and interfaces in their new locations.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4 id="separationOfDiagramSpecificConcept-step1">Move diagram-specific EClasses into a separate EPackage</h4>
		<p>For historical reasons, the core Sirius metamodels defined in viewpoint.ecore contain both generic (dialect-independant like Viewpoint, RepresentationDescription, DAnalysis...) concepts and diagram-specific ones (e.g. DNode, EdgeStyle, ContainerCreationDescription...). The table and tree metamodels are more cleanly separated.
			<br/>This milestone (Sirius 1.0M5) includes the first step towards a full separation of the diagram-specific stuff out of the core of Sirius. So many EClasses have been moved.
		</p>
		<p>Most of the time, existing code which used these Sirius EClasses will only need to perform a simple &#8220;Organize Imports&#8221; operation, which should find the classes and interfaces in their new locations.
			<br/>The &#8220;Organize imports&#8221; is not sufficient in case of imported classes existing several time in different packages (
			<code>EFactory</code> classes for example with 
			<code>DescriptionFactory</code>, or 
			<code>EPackage</code> classes for example with 
			<code>DescriptionPackage</code>). And in some cases 
			<code>ViewpointFactory</code> (and 
			<code>ViewpointPackage</code>) will have to be replaced by 
			<code>DiagramFactory</code> (and 
			<code>DiagramPackage</code>).
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<code>Switch</code> classes if overridden also require a particular attention.
		</p>
		<p>The existing VSM (
			<code>*.odesign</code>) and representations file (
			<code>*.aird</code>) are automatically migrated.
			<br/>Warning: Nevertheless, if you reference these Sirius concepts with the EPackage qualifier in your VSM (
			<code>*.odesign</code>), in interpreted expressions for example, you must change 
			<code>viewpoint</code> in 
			<code>diagram</code>. For example 
			<code>viewpoint::DDiagramElement</code> becomes 
			<code>diagram::DDiagramElement</code>.
		</p>
		<p>The impacted EPackages are :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint</code> : some of its EClasses have been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/diagram</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint/description</code> : some of its EClasses have been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/diagram/description</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint/description/style</code> : some of its EClasses have been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/diagram/description/style</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint/description/tool</code> : some of its EClasses have been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/diagram/description/tool</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>viewpoint/description/filter</code> : this EPackage has been moved to 
				<code>viewpoint/diagram/description/filter</code>

			</li>
			<li>The deprecated field

		<h2 id="sirius0.9">Changes in Sirius 0.9.0</h2>
		<p>Version 0.9.0 is the first release under the Sirius name and under the Eclipse Foundation umbrella. Except for the few cases mentioned below (in the &#8220;Other API Changes&#8221;, &#8220;Specifier-Visible Changes&#8221; and &#8220;User-Visible Changes&#8221; sections), Sirius 0.9.0 is functionally equivalent to the latest version of Viewpoint (version 6.10), which was the name of the project before it was open sourced at Eclipse. See the rest of the documentation for the complete list of feature of the Sirius platform.</p>
		<h3 id="MigratingfromObeoDesignerorViewpointtoSirius">Migrating from Obeo Designer or Viewpoint to Sirius</h3>
		<p>If you have existing projects which used this technology before it became Eclipse Sirius and want to migrate to Sirius, you must:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>first migrate your projects and models to the latest pre-Sirius version of Viewpoint or Obeo Designer available to you (Viewpoint is the previous name of Sirius);</li>
			<li>then migrate those to Sirius 0.9.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The latest version of Viewpoint which was available in an Obeo Designer release is Viewpoint 6.8, released in Obeo Designer 6.2. Sirius 0.9 is based on Viewpoint 6.10, which was not released publicly.</p>
		<p>If you were using Obeo Designer, you must thus first migrate your projects and models to Obeo Designer 6.2, and then consult the 
			<a href="release_notes_vp.html">release notes for Viewpoint 6.9 and 6.10</a>, which lists the API changes from Viewpoint 6.8 to 6.10.
		</p>
		<p>Once your projects are compatible with the latest Viewpoint available to you, you can migrate to Sirius, first by updating your Viewpoint Specification Projects and plug-ins which use the Viewpoint APIs, then by updating any Modeling Project and representation files (
			<code>*.aird</code>).
		</p>
		<h4 id="MigratingViewpointSpecificationProjects">Migrating Viewpoint Specification Projects</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Any plug-in dependencies towards Viewpoint plug-ins must be updated to the corresponding Sirius plug-in and version number. See the correspondence table below for the plug-in names to use.</li>
			<li>If your plug-ins used any of the extension points defined in Viewpoint, you will need to update your 
				<code>plugin.xml</code> files to reference the correct extension points identifiers. In particular, all Viewpoint Specification Projects created using Viewpoint use the 
				<code>fr.obeo.dsl.viewpoint.componentization</code> in their 
				<code>plugin.xml</code> to register the VSMs they define. This should be changed to use the equivalent 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.componentization</code> extension point id. The identifier changes for the other extension points follow the same rules as the name changes of the plug-ins they are defined in.
			</li>
			<li>The migration of your VSMs (
				<code>*.odesign</code> files) is automatic: simply open your files once in the VSM editor, perform some no-op change to make the editor &#8220;dirty&#8221; and save it. The saved version will have been migrated to Sirius.
			</li>
			<li>If you had Java code which used the Viewpoint APIs, you will need to update it to use the Sirius APIs. A simple &#8220;Source &gt; Organize Imports&#8221; on your source folders should find most classes you used in their new namespace. The Viewpoint code base and APIs used the term &#8220;Viewpoint&#8221; both for the name of the product and for the name of the concept. When it refered to the name of the product, the names were changed to use &#8220;Sirius&#8221; instead, so you may need to adjust some names in your code beyond just updating the imports (for example, 
				<code>ViewpointControlCommand</code> is now 
				<code>SiriusControlCommand</code>).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that if you used Obeo Designer, you may have used the legacy Acceleo 2.x language for the computed expressions inside the 
			<code>*.odesign</code> files (if your expressions are of the form 
			<code>&lt;%something%&gt;</code> then you used the legacy language). That language is not supported anymore in Sirius 0.9, so you must migrate your expressions to use Acceleo 3 and/or the specialized interpreters (
			<code>var:</code>, 
			<code>feature:</code> and 
			<code>service:</code>, see the documentation).
		</p>
		<h4 id="MigratingModelingProjectsandRepresentationFiles">Migrating Modeling Projects and Representation Files</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>First migrate any modeler definitions used by your modeling projects and representation files (see the section above).</li>
			<li>Modeling projects created using Viewpoint will not be recognized directly by Sirius, because the nature identfier has changed. You must use the &#8220;Configure/Convert to Modeling Project&#8221; action in the project&#8217;s context menu to make it a Sirius-compatible modeling project (see the section below for the technical details of the change).</li>
			<li>The migration of you representation files (
				<code>*.aird</code>) is performed automatically when they are loaded in memory. It will become permanent the first time you save it (you can force this by opening a representation, making some arbitrary change and saving the session).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Pluginsversionnumbers.">Plug-ins version numbers.</h3>
		<p>As of Sirius 0.9, and probably at least until Sirius 1.0 when the APIs will be more stable, all the bundles share the same version, which is also the version for the feature. If you used versioned dependencies to the old Viewpoint code (e.g. dependencies towards Viewpoint 6.8), you need to adjust the versions in your 
			<code>MANIFEST.MF</code> files in addition to the namespaces.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Majornamespacechanges">Major namespace changes</h3>
		<p>In the context of the move as an official Eclipse project named Sirius, all the namespaces used in the code have changed.</p>
		<h4 id="Pluginandfeaturesidentifiers">Plug-in and features identifiers</h4>
		<p>All identifiers have changed to start with the 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius</code> namespace prefix. The tables below give the mapping between the Viewpoint plug-in and features identifiers and their Sirius equivalent.

		<p>The Java package names have changed to start with the identifier of the plug-in they are defined in (which has changed). A simple &#8220;Source &gt; Organize Imports&#8221; on your source folders should find most classes you used in their new namespace.</p>
		<p>The Viewpoint code base and APIs used the term &#8220;Viewpoint&#8221; both for the name of the product and for the name of the concept. When it refered to the name of the product, the names where changed to use &#8220;Sirius&#8221; instead (for example, 
			<code>ViewpointControlCommand</code> is now 
			<code>SiriusControlCommand</code>).
		</p>
		<h4 id="ModelsnamespaceURIs">Models namespace URIs</h4>
		<p>All namespace URIs have also been changed from &#8220;http://www.obeo.fr/dsl/viewpoint*&#8221; to &#8220;http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/&#8221;.</p>
		<p>If you have created VSM file (.odesign) or representations file (.aird) with Viewpoint, the changes of the namespace URIs will be automatically migrated during the loading of your VSM or your representations file. These new nsURIs will be stored physically in the file during the first save. If the file is not saved, the automatic migration will be replayed at the next opening.</p>
		<h3 id="NatureID">Nature ID</h3>
		<p>The modeling project has a specific nature (
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.nature.modelingproject</code>).
			<br/>If you have modeling project created with Viewpoint, you must launch the action &#8220;Configure/Convert to Modeling Project&#8221; to replace old nature id (
			<code>fr.obeo.dsl.viewpoint.nature.modelingproject</code>) by the new one.
			<br/>If you have many modeling projects to &#8220;migrate&#8221;, you can easily make a script to replace 
			<code>fr.obeo.dsl.viewpoint.nature.modelingproject</code> by 
			<code>org.eclipse.sirius.nature.modelingproject</code> in all 
			<code>.project</code> file of each modeling projects.

		<h3 id="OtherAPIChanges">Other API Changes</h3>
		<p>This section only lists API changes in Sirius 0.9.0 compared to the latest version of Viewpoint it is based on, i.e. Viewpoint 6.10.</p>
		<h4 id="APIAdded">API Added</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Add 
				<code>IMigrationParticipant.getPackage()</code> to return the EPackage to use for the given namespace. This change concerns our internal migration framework. This is useful to handle our namespace changes (from Viewpoint to Sirius).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="APIRemoval">API Removal</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Removed 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.IAcceleoInterpreterVariables</code>: This interface only defined a single constant, which refered to the syntax of an obsolete version of the Acceleo language.
			</li>
			<li>Removed 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.resource.IFileContributorExtension</code>: This interface only defined a few constants relative to an extension point which does not exist anymore.
			</li>
			<li>Removed the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius.reconciler</code> extension point definition (which used to be defined in the 
				<code>org.eclipse.sirius</code> plug-in): This extension point is not supported anymore (and has not been for a long time).
			</li>
			<li>Removed all the deprecated methods from 
				<code>Session</code> and replaced the internal calls with the equivalent versions with 
				<code>IProgressMonitors</code>. The removed methods are:
			</li>
		</ul>
		<pre>void open();
void addSemanticResource(Resource newResource, boolean addCrossReferencedResources);
void addSemanticResource(URI semanticModelURI, boolean addCrossReferencedResources);
void addSemanticResource(URI semanticModelURI, boolean addCrossReferencedResources, IProgressMonitor monitor);
void removeSemanticResource(Resource resource, boolean removeCrossReferencedResources);
void removeSemanticResource(Resource semanticResource);
void save();
void close();
Collection&lt;Viewpoint&gt; getSelectedViewpoints();
void createView(Viewpoint viewpoint, Collection&lt;EObject&gt; semantics);
void createView(Viewpoint viewpoint, Collection&lt;EObject&gt; semantics, boolean createNewRepresentations);
void addSelectedView(DView view) throws IllegalArgumentException;
void removeSelectedView(DView view);

</pre>
		<h3 id="SpecifierVisibleChanges5">Specifier-Visible Changes</h3>
		<p>New variables are available for 
			<code>sizeComputationExpression</code> to compute the size of edges on 
			<code>EdgeStyleDescription</code> and 
			<code>BracketEdgeStyleDescription</code>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>diagram</em>: the current 
				<code>DDiagram</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>view</em>: the current 
				<code>DEdge</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>sourceView</em>: the source view of the current edge.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>targetView</em>: the target view of the current edge.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="UserVisibleChanges6">User-Visible Changes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to print table representations has been disabled for the 0.9 release due to an external dependency issue (see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=422223" target="_blank">bug #422223</a>: for the details). It should be re-introduced in 1.0.</li>
		</ul>
