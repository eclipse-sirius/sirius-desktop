h1. Specifying Properties Views

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}

h2(#introduction). Introduction

Starting from version 4.0, Sirius supports the definition of properties views with many features like complex styling, validation, context etc.

Properties views are defined inside the VSM in a way that is similar to other Sirius representations. The configuration elements in the VSM identify a sub-set of the elements in the semantic model to which they apply, and associate to them widgets, which will be visible in the Eclipse _Properties View_ to view and edit the elements's properties.

The configuration _maps_ semantic elements onto some properties view elements. At runtime, each active properties element (pages, groups, widgets) will produce zero or more elements in the properties view, depending on how many semantic elements currently match the properties element's definition. Whenever the current selection changes Sirius will automatically re-compute which elements should appear in the properties view according to the active widgets, and create or remove the necessary elements in the properties view.

Sirius properties view are enabled whenever the selected element is part of an opened session, i.e. any element selected inside a Sirius editor or from the _Model Explorer_ view on an opened session.

Note that if you have the (optional) support for Sirius-defined properties views correctly installed but do not specify anything inside your VSMs, Sirius will apply default generic rules to provide a canonical properties view for your model elements. As soon as you specify your own configuration, as described in this document, the default rules will be ignored in favor of yours. See "below":#default_rules for how both approaches can be combined.

You can create a _Properties View_ description under the root element of an odesign thanks to three specific menu items.

!images/new-properties.png!

* The first menu is used to create a blank _Properties View_ description. With this menu, you will start your _Property View_ definition from scratch.
* The second menu can copy the default rules directly inside of the odesign. While powerful, those default rules can be quite complex for new users.
* The third menu can create a new _Properties View_ which will extends the default rules. Using this mechanism, you can leverage all the default rules and you have the ability to easily add new rules.

h2(#properties_view_description). Properties View Description

Properties view are configured by creating a _Properties View Description_ element (directly under the top-level "_Group_":../general/Specifying_Viewpoints.html#vsm_organization element of the VSM) and its sub-elements (which describe the widgets, the actions, the layout, etc.).

Like many elements inside a "_VSM_":../../Glossary.html#VSM, _View Extension Description_ have an optional _Identifier_, which should be unique.

Inside a _Properties View Description_ element, you can create:
* "_Categories_":#categories, which exist only for the specifier convenience to order his specification;

Inside a _Category_ element, you can create:
* "_Pages_":#pages, which correspond to "tabs";
* "_Groups_":#groups, which represent named sections inside a page/tab which contain the actual widgets;
* "_Overrides_":#overrides, which allows to override part of an existing properties view description. 

It is recommended that the _Properties View Description_ be explicitly associated with the meta-model(s) of the semantic elements it will represent. You can add referenced meta-models from different sources in the _Metamodels_ property section of the _Properties View Description_. Sirius will work even without this association, but setting it explicitly will give you better feedback when validating your "_VSM_":../../Glossary.html#VSM.

The descriptions for all the different types of properties view elements share the same common principles:
* Some of the elements of the semantic model are selected, using a combination of configuration attributes (see below). These elements are called _targets_, and each one has a single widget of this type representing it.
* The graphical aspect of the properties view is defined by a _style_. Sirius provides a rich set of possible styles, which are described later in this document.
* Optionally, a behavior for the properties view element depending on the widget kind can be defined (edition for text field, on click action for hyperlink or buttons...).

p(#context). *Context.* Each properties view element is defined in a _context_ in the VSM. At runtime, the corresponding _context element_ would be the semantic element associated to the properties view element description. This context element is used as a starting point to determine which instances of a properties view element description should be created on the properties view:
# First, the _Semantic Candidates Expression_ of the description is evaluated, starting from the context element. It should return a set (possibly empty) of elements in the semantic model.
# This list of candidates is then filtered using the _Domain Class_ specified in the description: only the candidates which are instance of the specified class are retained.
# Finally, the optional _Precondition Expression_ of the element is evaluated, once for each of the remaining candidates. It should return a boolean value. Only the candidates for which the predicate returns a true value are kept and will actually produce an element on the properties view.

This order of evaluation should be kept in mind when specifying properties view. In particular, to avoid performance issues you should:
* Limit the number of model elements with _Semantic Candidate Expression_.
* Avoid testing instances type in _Semantic Candidate Expression_ (this will be done anyway when filtering the _Domain Class_).
* Use the most specific type in _Domain Class_.
* Avoid navigation and long computations in _Precondition Expression_.

*Properties View Elements Definition.* Properties views support several different types of elements, which are described in the following sections. They are:
* "pages":#pages, which represent properties view *Tab* that can contain sections.
* "groups":#groups, which represent properties view *Section* that can contain widgets.
* "widgets":#widgets describe the different kind of widgets supported, like texts, buttons, labels, checkboxes, radio groups...
* "dynamic mappings":#dynamic_mappings are used for advanced scenarios where the set of widgets to display can not be known statically, but instead must be computed at runtime.
* "containers and layout":#containers_and_layout are used to organize and layout multiple related widgets.
* "overrides":#overrides are used to override the properties view of an existing properties view description.

p(#default_rules). *Default Properties View Rules.* When no properties view definition is found for an element selected by the user, Sirius will apply default rules which attempt to give a usable (if generic) result for most user models. As soon as you define _some_ custom rules for your modelers, _only_ these custom rules will apply, and the default ones will be ignored. If you want to mix the default rules for some of your elements and custom ones only for some specific types, you can:
* Extend the default rules model inside your VSM: from the top-level element of the VSM model, select _New Properties> Extend Default Properties View_. This will allow you to redefine the behavior of the default rules thanks to the "extension mechanism"#extensibility_features.
* Import a copy of the default rules model inside your VSM: from the top-level element of the VSM model, select _New Properties > Import Default Properties View_.
* Add your custom rules (pages and groups) and optionally update the default ones to not apply for the elements for which you provide more specific views (typically by modifying the _Precondition Expression_ of the default _Page_), to do so from the top-level element of the VSM model, select _New Properties > New Default Properties View_.

*Legacy Sirius Tabs.* By default, the legacy _Semantic_ and _Default_ tabs which show the raw properties of the selected element in a plain property grid are still visible even when you have defined custom properties views (the _Semantic_ tab is visible when the selection is from a Sirius representation; the _Default_ tab is shown when selecting from the _Model Explorer_). If you want to hide these legacy tabs and only show your custom tabs, you can do so by changing the preferences in the _Sirius > Sirius Properties View_ category.

h3(#common_attributes). Common Attributes

The following attributes are mostly shared by all the properties view element description (page, group, container, widget).

p(#identifier). *Identifier.* Each properties view element description defines an optional attribute _Identifier_. It can be used to distinguish elements of the same type in the VSM editor, and in advanced customization scenarios where the VSM model is programmatically accessed/modified.

p(#domain_class). *Domain Class.* The optional _Domain Class_ attribute is the type of semantic elements which are represented by the properties view element definition. The syntax for the domain class name can be the basic name, like @Package@, a qualified name using name of the EMF EPackage which defines the type, like @uml.Package@, or a fully qualified URI like @http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/3.0.0/UML#//Package@.
An empty _Domain Class_ means that the element being defined will be applicable to any model element of any type. By default, new properties view elements can be created on _any_ instance of the _Domain Class_.

p(#precondition_expression). *Precondition Expression.* You can use the _Precondition Expression_ to change this. If such an expression is specified, it will be evaluated in the "context":#context of the semantic element the user has selected, and only if the expression returns @true@ will the properties view element be applied to that semantic element.

p(#label_expression). *Label Expression.* This expression is used to compute the text of the label describing the element (which will typically appear on the left of a widget). The _Label expression_ is evaluated in the context of the semantic element and should return a string. If the expression is not specified, the default label is empty.

p(#help_expression). *Help Expression.* The help text of a properties view element is specified using the _Help expression_, which is evaluated in the context of the semantic element and should return a string. It will appear as a tooltip on the question-mark icon associated to a widget.

p(#is_enabled_expression). *Is Enabled Expression.* Each widget can be enabled or disabled (making it visible but read-only) . The _Is Enabled Expression_ is evaluated in the context of the semantic element and should return a boolean. It the expression is not specified it defaults to _true_ (meaning the widget is enabled).

p(#semantic_candidate_expression). *Semantic Candidate Expression.* The _Semantic Candidate Expression_ defines the model element represented by the properties view element.

p(#styles). *Styles.* Each kind of properties view element supports a rich set of possible "styles":#styling.

To find some documentation for each properties, you can also refer to the tool-tips available directly in the editor on the "question mark" icon of each property.

Here is an example of a widget configuration (a single-line "text":#text in this case) which illustrates some of the common attributes:

!images/basic-properties-example-vsm.png!

The _Text Element Name (non-editable)_ element has the exact same configuration except that its _Label Expression_ is @Name (read-only):@ and its _Is Enabled Expression_ is set to @aql:false@.

Here is the resulting properties view rendered for a diagram element:

!images/basic-properties-example-diagram.png! 

We see both label expressions on the left of each widget, help icons which show the computed _Help Expression_ when the user leaves the mouse pointer on them, and the actual widgets. The second text widget is disabled (visible thanks to the light blue background) because of its  _Is Enabled Expression_.

h3(#additional_services). Additional Services

Beside @self@, which represents the current context element on which an expression is evaluated, every expression defined inside a _Property View Description_ has access to an additional special variable named @input@, which offers some additional services. For a given user selection, the value of @input@ is the same everywhere inside a _Property View Description_; it corresponds to a descriptor of what the user select and can be used to obtain contextual information.

*Services on @input@.*
* @input.getOriginalSelection()@: returns the original, raw element selected by the user before any unwrapping or interpretation. This may not be a model element; for Sirius diagrams for example this will be an @EditPart@.
* @input.getSemanticElement()@: returns the main semantic element associated with the selection. This will correspond to the @self@ variable inside a _Page_, but inside a group @self@ may have a different value is _Semantic Candidate Expressions_ were used, so this service can be used to obtain the "original self" from anywhere.
* @input.getAllSemanticElements()@: returns _all_ the semantic model elements associated with the selection, not just the main one. This will include additional @DRepresentationElement#semanticElements@ if there are any.
* @input.emfEditServices(EObject)@: provides a handle to invoke "EMF Edit"-related services on the model element specified in argument. See below for the list of services that can be called on the result.
* @input.context()@: provides a handle to invoke additional services to obtain more information about the overall context of the selection. See below fot the list of services that can be called on the result.

*Services on @input.emfEditServices(EObject)@.* In the descriptions below, @obj@ designates the @EObject@ instance which was passed to @emfEditServices()@.
* @getChoiceOfValues(EStructuralFeature)@: returns all the possible values for the specified feature of @obj@, as defined by its @IItemPropertyDescriptor@. 
* @getDescription(EStructuralFeature)@: returns the (textual) description of the specified feature of @obj@, as defined by its @IItemPropertyDescriptor@.
* @getEStructuralFeatures()@: returns all the features of @obj@ that would be shown in the properties view by default. This ignores transient, derived and containment features.
* @getImage()@: returns the image (icon) to use for @obj@, as defined by its @IItemLabelProvider@.
* @getText()@: returns the textual representation to use for @obj@, as defined by its @IItemLabelProvider@.
* @getText(EStructuralFeature)@: returns the "display name" of the specified feature of @obj@, as defined by its @IItemPropertyDescriptor@, or the textual representation of the feature itself (as defined by its own @IItemLabelProvider@) if no display name is defined.
* @isMultiline(EStructuralFeature)@: checks whether the specified feature of @obj@ (which is assumed to be textual) should be represented on muliple lines, as defined by its @IItemPropertyDescriptor.isMultiLine()@ method.
* @needsCheckboxWidget(EStructuralFeature)@: checks whether the specified feature of @obj@ can be represented by a checkbox widget (i.e. it is a single-valued @boolean@ or @java.lang.Boolean@).
* @needsTextWidget(EStructuralFeature)@: checks whether the specified feature of @obj@ can be represented by a text (or text area) widget (i.e. it is a single-valued string, number or date). 
* @setValue(EStructuralFeature, Object)@: sets the value of the specified feature of @obj@ to the given value. This is a thin wrapper around @EObject.eSet()@ and should only be used inside widget actions as it modifies the model. It only handles basic cases; explicit model operations or custom services should be prefered if possible.

*Services on @input.context()@.*
* @mainSemanticElement()@: returns the main semantic element associated with the selection. This is equivalent to @input.getSemanticElement()@.
* @allSemanticElements()@: returns _all_ the semantic model elements associated with the selection, not just the main one. This is equivalent to  @input.getAllSemanticElements()@.
* @representation()@: returns the @DRepresentation@ instance in which the current input was selected, or _null_ if the element was selected from the _Model Explorer_.
* @semanticDecorator()@: returns the @DSemanticDecorator@ instance which was selected.
* @session()@: return the @Session@ in the context of which the selection was done. This is a Java object which can only be used by additional (custom) Java services.

h2(#categories). Categories

A _Category_ is used to sort the "pages":#pages and the "groups":#groups. The category does not represent anything in the final user properties view, the category exists only for the specifier convenience to order the specification. For example a _Reused_ category can be created to store all the groups that would be used by different "pages":#pages and "dialogs":../general/Model_Operations.html#dialogandwizard.
Categories can be created 

h2(#pages). Pages

A _Page_ is used to represent a *Tab* in the properties view.

!images/pages.png(Properties can be organized in separate tabs, defined by Page Description elements)! 

Pages are configured by creating a _Page_ element inside a _Properties View Description_. In the illustration above, the two pages _General_ and _Hierarchy_ have been defined from the VSM. They appear above the standard tabs provided by Sirius (_Semantic_, _Advanced_, etc.).

Much like the other properties view elements, you must specify the "_Identifier_":#identifier, "_Domain Class_":#domain_class, "_Precondition Expression_":#precondition_expression, "_Label Expression_":#label_expression, "_Semantic Candidate Expression_":#semantic_candidate_expression.

The definition of a page follows the general rules described "above":#properties_view_description to determine the semantic elements for which a page should be created.

A page's content is defined by the "_Groups_":#groups it references, which are defined directly under the _Properties View Description_. The groups are ordered in the page accordingly to their order in the groups reference list in the VSM.

h3(#page-toolbar-action). Toolbar Actions

A page can also define toolbar actions which will be used to create buttons in the toolbar of the page to let the end user execute some operations easily. A _Toolbar Action_ can have a tooltip by returning a string for the _Tooltip expression_. They also contain an _Initial Operation_ used to define the model operations to execute when the user will click on the button. Finally a _Toolbar Action_ can have an image thanks to an _Image expression_. The _Image expression_ must return a string with the following structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif. If an image is not provided or not found, a default image will be used.

h2(#groups). Groups

A _Group_ is used to represent a *Section* in a properties view tab.

!images/groups.png(Inside a tab, properties can be grouped in foldable sections)!

Groups are configured by creating a _Group_ element inside a _Properties View Description_. Groups will only be visible inside a tab if they are referenced by the corresponding _Page_. By default, a newly created _Group_ element is not part of any page, so you _must_ add it explicitly to the _Pages_ where it should appear. A single _Group_ definition can be referenced in as many _Page_ definition as needed; this allows sharing common sections between different pages.

Much like the other properties view elements, you must specify the "_Identifier_":#identifier, "_Domain Class_":#domain_class, "_Precondition Expression_":#precondition_expression, "_Label Expression_":#label_expression, "_Semantic Candidate Expression_":#semantic_candidate_expression, "_Styles_":#styles, "_Conditional Styles_":#conditional_styles.

The definition of a group follows the general rules described "above":#properties_view_description to determine the semantic elements for which a group should be created.

A group can contain "_widgets_":#widgets, "_containers_":#containers_and_layout to organize them, and "_validation rules_":#validation_rules, all of which are defined inside the group description (_New Widget > Container|Text..._ and _New > Group Validations_, respectively).

h3(#group-toolbar-action). Toolbar Actions

A group can also define toolbar actions which will be used to create buttons in the toolbar of the group to let the end user execute some operations easily. A _Toolbar Action_ can have a tooltip by returning a string for the _Tooltip expression_. They also contain an _Initial Operation_ used to define the model operations to execute when the user will click on the button. Finally a _Toolbar Action_ can have an image thanks to an _Image expression_. The _Image expression_ must return a string with the following structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif. If an image is not provided or not found, a default image will be used.

h3(#widgets-from-domain-class). Widgets From Domain Class

!images/widget-from-domain-class.png(Create easily a widget for each structural feature of your EClass)!

By specifying the _Domain Class_ of a group and by specifying the metamodels on the relevant container of the group (like the Properties View object), you will have access to a new contextual action used to create a default version of a widget for each of the structural features of your _Domain Class_. You can create all the widgets at once or only the desired ones. The configuration generated in your odesign is heavily inspired by the default rules available, as such all the EString properties will be handled by a text widget, all the EBoolean properties by a checkbox, etc.

h3(#group_styles). Group Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles. This section only presents the aspects which are specific to groups.

For groups you can define the following style attributes:
* _Background Color_: You can specify the background color using "colors":#colors from the standard or user-defined palette.
* _Bar Style_: Is used to define the section style. There are 3 different styles: @TITLE BAR@, @SHORT TITLE BAR@, @NO TITLE@ (see the first table below for illusrations of these styles).
* _Expanded by Default_: This flag is used to define if the section should be initialy expanded or collapsed.
* _Font Name Expression_: Is used to computes the name of the font to use.
* _Font size Expression_: Indicates the font size to use in points.
* _Foreground Color_: You can specify the foreground color using "color":#colors from the standard or user-defined palette.
* _Toggle style_: Is used to define the style of the toggle. There are 3 different toggles: @TWISTIE@, @TREE NODE@, @NONE@ (see the second table below for illusrations of these styles).

The following tables illustrate the different _Bar Style_ and _Toggle Style_ available on groups:

table(table table-striped table-condensed).
|!images/group-style-titlebar.png!|!images/group-style-short-titlebar.png!|!images/group-style-no-title.png!|
|_. @TITLE BAR@|_. @SHORT TITLE BAR@|_. @NO TITLE@|

table(table table-striped table-condensed).
|!images/group-style-toggle-twistie.png!|!images/group-style-toggle-treenode.png!|!images/group-style-toggle-none.png!|
|_. @TWISTIE@|_. @TREE NODE@|_. @NONE@|


h2(#widgets). Widgets

A widget is used to represent model elements in the properties view and, for most of them, to allow users to edit said elements. Widgets can appear directly inside a group, a "dynamic mapping":#dynamic_mappings or inside a "container":#containers_and_layout, in which case you can specify a specific "layout":#containers_and_layout which will be used to graphically organize all the widgets inside the container.

The definition of a widget follows the general rules described "above":#properties_view_description to determine the semantic elements for which a widget should be created.

Much like the other properties view elements, you can specify the widget's "_Label Expression_":#label_expression, "_Help Expression_":#help_expression,  "_Is Enabled Expression_":#is_enabled_expression, "_Styles_":#styles, "_Conditional Styles_":#conditional_styles.

h3(#text). Text / Text area

A _Text_ widget is used to represent a *single line text* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-text.png!

A _Text Area_ is used to represent a *multiple lines text* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-textarea.png!

The definition of a text/text area follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a text should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For texts and text areas, you must define the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the text displayed in the text field and should return a string. If the expression is not specified, the default value is an empty string. The expression is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For text areas, you must define the _Line Count_ which represents the height of the text area in number of lines.

h4(#edit_text). Text Edition

To define the behavior of the text when a change occurs, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element directly contained inside the widget, using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

The operations defined under the _Begin_ can use the @newValue@ variable which represents the value entered by the user (as a string). The root operation is executed in the context of the semantic target element.

Sirius automatically invokes the edit operation when the focus leaves the widget. For single-line _Text_ widgets, the edit operation is also triggered when the user hits _Enter_. Note that if an error occurs while executing the edit operation, the whole effect of the operation on the underlying model is cancelled, and an error is logged.

h4(#text_styles). Text/Text Area Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets. This section only presents the aspects which are specific to texts.

One of the responsibility of texts styles is to describe how text fields will be formated. The following properties are available :
* _Font Name Expression_: Is used to compute the name of the font to use for the text field.
* _Font Size Expression_ : Indicates the font size to use in points.
* _Background Color_: You can specify the background color of the text field using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Foreground Color_: You can specify the foreground color of the text field using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Font Format_: Is used to specify the font style attributes (Bold and/or Italic and/or Underline and/or Strike through).

Here are examples of text and text area widgets with some of their style attributes customized:

!images/widget-text-styling.png(Text and TextArea widgets with customized style)!

h3(#button). Button

A _Button_ is used to represent a *button* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout, that can be used to trigger an arbitrary (configurable) operation on the model.

!images/widget-button.png(Example of a button widget)!

The definition of a button follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a button should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For buttons, you must define the _Button Label Expression_ which is used to compute the label displayed on the button and should return a string. If the expression is not specified, the default value is the empty string. You can also specify an image with the _Image expression_. An image can be used instead of a button label or along with it. The _Image expression_ should return a string with the structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif

h4(#pushed_button). Behavior executed on click

To define the behavior of the button when it is clicked, simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html. The root operation is executed in the context of the semantic target element.

h4(#button_styles). Button Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#label). Label

A _Label_ is used to represent a *non editable text* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

Here is an example which shows two label widgets:

!images/widget-label.png(Examples of label widgets)!

The definition of a label follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a label should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For labels, you must define the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the text displayed in the description. The _Value Expression_ can return any kind of object but the result displayed will be the result of a call to @Object.toString()@. If you want to customize how the result will be displayed, you can return a string in the value expression or use the _Display Expression_. The _Display Expression_ will have access to the result of the _Value Expression_ using the variable @value@ and it should return a string. If the expression is not specified, the default value is the empty string.

h4(#label_actions). Widget Actions

A _Label_ can optionally define one or more _Widget Actions_, which are created as children element of the _Label_ element (_New > Widget Action_). Each action has a _Label Expression_ and a behavior defined by "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html contained inside. If present, actions will be rendered as buttons on the right of the label itself. The button's text is defined by the _Label Expression_, and its behavior when pushed by the model operations. You can also specify an image with the _Image expression_. An image can be used instead of a label or along with it. The _Image expression_ should return a string with the structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif

h4(#label_styles). Label Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets. This section only presents the aspects which are specific to texts.

One of the responsibility of labels styles is to describe how descriptions will be formated. The following properties are available :
* _Font Name Expression_: Is used to compute the name of the font to use for the description.
* _Font Size Expression_ : Indicates the font size to use in points.
* _Background Color_: You can specify the background color of the description using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Foreground Color_: You can specify the foreground color of the description using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Font Format_: Is used to specify the font style attributes (Bold and/or Italic and/or Underline and/or Strike through).

!images/widget-label-styling.png(Example of labels with customized style)!

h3(#checkbox). Checkbox

A _Checkbox_ is used to represent a *checkbox* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-checkbox.png(Examples of checkbox widgets)!

The definition of a checkbox follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a checkbox should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For checkboxes, you must define the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the checked/unchecked state of the checkbox and so should return a boolean (return _true_ to display the checkbox checked).

h4(#checkbox_change_value). Change value

To define the behavior of the checkbox when the user clicks on it, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

The operations defined under the _Begin_ can use the @newValue@ variable which represents the value set by the user as a boolean; it will be _true_ if the checkbox was unchecked before, and the user clicked on it to check it, _false_ otherwise. Note that if an error occurs while executing the edit operation, the whole effect of the operation on the underlying model is canelled, and an error is logged.

h4(#checkbox_styles). Checkbox Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#select). Select

A _Select_ is used to represent a *combo box* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-select.png(Example of a select widget)!

The definition of a select follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a select should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For selects, you must define :
* the _Candidates Expression_ which is used to compute the candidates available in the combo and should return a list of elements from which the user can select the select's value.
* the _Candidate Display Expression_ which is used to compute the label displayed for each possible candidate in the combo and so should return a string. The _Candidate Display Expression_ can use the @candidate@ variable which represents the element currently evaluated.
* the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the element selected in the combo and should return an object, which should be an element of the collection returned by _Candidates Expression_.

h4(#select_change_value). Change value

To define the behavior of the _Select_ when the user selects a different element, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

The expressions defined under the _Begin_ can use the @newValue@ variable which represents the value selected by the user. Note that if an error occurs while executing the edit operation, the whole effect of the operation on the underlying model is cancelled, and an error is logged.

h4(#select_styles). Select Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#radio_group). Radio Group

A _Radio_ is used to represent a *radio group* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-radio.png(Example of a radio group widget)!

The definition of a radio group follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a radio group should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For radio groups, you must define :
* the _Candidates Expression_ which is used to compute the candidates available in the radio group and should return a list of elements from which the user can select the radio group’s value.
* the _Candidate Display Expression_ which is used to compute the label displayed for each possible candidate in the radio group and so should return a string. The _Candidate Display Expression_ can use the @candidate@ variable which represents the element currently evaluated.
* the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the element selected in the radio group and should return an object, which should be an element of the collection returned by _Candidates Expression_.

h4(#radio_change_value). Change value

To define the behavior of the radio group when the selection changes, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

The expressions defined under the _Begin_ can use the @newValue@ variable which represents the value selected by the user. Note that if an error occurs while executing the edit operation, the whole effect of the operation on the underlying model is cancelled, and an error is logged.

h4(#radio_styles). Radio Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#hyperlink). Hyperlink

A _Hyperlink_ is used to represent an *hyperlink* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

!images/widget-hyperlink.png(Example of an hyperlink widget)!

The definition of an hyperlink follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which an hyperlink should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For hyperlinks, you must define the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the hyperlink displayed. The _Value Expression_ can return any kind of object but the result displayed will be the result of a call to _java.lang.Object#toString()_. If you want to customize how the result will be displayed, you can return a String in the value expression or use the _Display Expression_. The _Display Expression_ will have access to the result of the _Value Expression_ using the variable named @value@ and it should return a String.

h4(#hyperlink_click_on_value). Behavior executed on click

To define the behavior of the hyperlink when it is clicked, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

h4(#hyperlink_actions). Widget Actions

A _Hyperlink_ can optionally define one or more _Widget Actions_, which are created as children element of the _Hyperlink_ element (_New > Widget Action_). Each action has a _Label Expression_ and a behavior defined by "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html contained inside. If present, actions will be rendered as buttons on the right of the label itself. The button's text is defined by the _Label Expression_, and its behavior when pushed by the model operations. You can also specify an image with the _Image expression_. An image can be used instead of a button label or along with it. The _Image expression_ should return a string with the structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif

h4(#hyperlink_styles). Hyperlink Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets. This section only presents the aspects which are specific to hyperlinks.

One of the responsibility of hyperlinks styles is to describe how hyperlinks will be formated. The following properties are available :
* _Font Name Expression_: Is used to compute the name of the font to use for the text field.
* _Font Size Expression_ : Indicates the font size to use in points.
* _Background Color_: You can specify the background color of the text field using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Font Format_: Is used to specify the font style attributes (Bold and/or Italic and/or Strike through).

h3(#reference). Reference

A _Reference_ is used to represent the value of a reference in the model.

The configuration of the _Reference_ widget is minimal. Beside the standard properties available on all widgets like _Label Expression_, _Help Expression_ and _Is Enabled Expression_, you only need to specify:
* _Reference Owner Expression_: optional, defaults to @var:self@. If specified, the reference to display will be looked on the element returned by the expression instead of the current one.
* _Reference Name Expression_: this should return a string which designates the name of the _EReference_ to display. It can be a fixed string or a computed expression.

The _Reference_ widget's appearance will depend whether the reference to display is single-valued or multi-valued:

!images/reference-single-value.png(A Reference widget displaying a single-valued reference)!

!images/reference-multiple-value.png(A Reference widget displaying a multi--valued reference)!

As mentioned above, the configurability of the _Reference_ widget is minimal, it determines all of its behavior using the standard EMF features:
* the value of the reference is obtained reflectively using @eGet@.
* the textual representation and icon of the value(s) of the reference are determined automatically using the corresponding @IItemLabelProvider@.
* the behavior of the action buttons is hard-coded to perform the standard operation when selecting a diffrente value (from an existing element in the model), creating a new instance to set as the value, removing an element, or moving up/down the elements in a multi-valued reference.

If you need more specific behavior, you need to use either an _Hyperlink_ (for single values) or a _List_ widget (for multiple values) with custom actions implementing the required behavior.

In a similar fashion as the hyperlink and the list widgets, it is possible to define an _Initial Operation_ on the reference widget in order to execute some model operations when the user will click on the widget. If an _Initial Operation_ is configured, the single-valued version of the widget will use a hyperlink instead of a regular label.

h4(#reference_styles). Reference Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#list). List

A _List_ is used to represent a *list with buttons* in a "group":#groups or in a "container":#containers_and_layout.

Depending on the parameters configuration the list widget will be represented thanks to a list and multiple buttons when "_Widget Actions_":#list_actions are defined.

The definition of a list follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a list should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For lists, you must define:
* the _Value Expression_ which is used to compute the element to display and should return an object.
* the _Display Expression_ which is used to compute the text displayed in the text field and should return a string. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element and has access to the variable @value@ which corresponds to the element to display.
* the "_Widget Actions_":#list_actions are used to associate some buttons to the text field.

h4(#list_on_click_operation). Behavior executed on click

To define the behavior, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html. A variable named @onClickEventKind@ is available to determine if the operation has been triggered by a single click or double click. In case of a single click, the variable has the value "SINGLE_CLICK" and "DOUBLE_CLICK" in case of a double click.

The expressions defined under the _Begin_ can use the @selection@ variable which represents the values selected by the user. This variable will contain the list of the values selected.

h4(#list_actions). Widget actions

A list can contain _actions_ which represent *buttons* associated to the list field.

For actions, you must define the _Label Expression_ which is used to compute the label displayed on the button and should return a string. If the expression is not specified, the default value is equal to @...@. You can also specify an image with the _Image expression_. An image can be used instead of a button label or along with it. The _Image expression_ should return a string with the structure PROJECT_NAME/IMAGE_PATH. For example: org.eclipse.sirius.sample.basicfamily.design/icons/Delete_16x16.gif

h4(#list_action_pushed_button). Action Pushed Button

To define the behavior of the button when is pushed, you simply specify the behavior associated to the edition inside the _Begin_ element using all the standard "model operations":../general/Model_Operations.html.

The expressions defined under the _Begin_ can use the @selection@ variable which represents the values selected by the user in the list field. Note that @selection@ is always a collection, even if only a single element is currently selected.

h4(#list_styles). List Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets.

h3(#basic_custom_widgets). Basic Custom Widgets

A _Custom Description_ is used when none of the predefined styles correspond to your need. Custom widgets are implemented in Java and use the @org.eclipse.eef.ide.ui.eefLifecycleManagerProvider@ extension point.

The definition of a custom widget follows the general rules described "above":#widgets to determine the semantic elements for which a custom widget should be created. It is evaluated in the context of the semantic target element.

For custom widgets, the _Identifier_ is mandatory. It is used to find the widget contributed with the extension point.

See "the reference documentation":../../developer/extensions-properties_provide_custom_widget_basic.html for how to actually implement your own basic custom widgets.

h5(#basic_custom_widgets_expression). Custom Expression/Operation

When you define a custom widget, it is possible to define some custom expression or operation which will be used by the custom widget implementation. 
In this case, the _Identifier_ is mandatory. It would be used in the Java code to find the expression/operation contributed with the VSM.

h5(#basic_custom_widgets_styles). Custom Styles

See the "styles":#styling section for a general presentation of how styles are defined, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles and "widgets styles":#widgets_styles section to find details on what is specific to widgets. This section only presents the aspects which are specific to texts.

h3(#advanced_custom_widgets). Advanced Custom Widgets

Basic custom widgets need to be configured using very generic _Custom Expression/Operation_, which makes them different and harder to use than the standard ones. Any configuration property which would be directly accessible in the VSM editor's property sheet on a standard widget will need a specific _Custom Expression_ with the exact expected identifier.

It is possible to improve custom widgets to be better integrated with the VSM editor, to the point that their configuration looks and feels like for any of the standard ones. For the specifier point of view, the configuration of these widgets follows the same principles as for the default ones.

See "the reference documentation":../../developer/extensions-properties_provide_custom_widget_advanced.html for how to actually implement your own advanced custom widgets.

h2(#dynamic_mappings). Dynamic Mappings

Dynamic mappings are used for advanced scenarios where the set of widgets to display can not be known statically, but instead must be computed at runtime. A dynamic mapping contains conditional widgets definition, each of which may be instantiated zero or multiple times at runtime.

A _Dynamic Mapping For_ can appear directly inside a group description, or inside a "container":#containers_and_layout, in which case you can specify a specific "layout":#containers_and_layout. You must specify an _Iterable Expression_ which computes a list of elements to iterate over. The _Iterator_ property must also be defined and corresponds to the name of the iteration variable that will be accessible inside the _For_. Inside the _Dynamic Mapping For_ you can create any number of _Dynamic Mapping If_, which defines a _Predicate Expression_ and can contain *one widget*.

At runtime, for a given input element selected by the user, Sirius will evaluate the _iterable expression_, and then for each of the elements returned will instanciate the widgets defined inside _Dynamic Mapping If_ whose predicate holds true.

The dynamic mapping mechanism is the one used by Sirius to provide by default properties view even if you do not specify any _Properties View Description_ in your VSM.
If we take one of the default rules implemented by Sirius we have:
* a _Dynamic Mapping For_ defining as _Iterable Expression_ : @aql:self.eClass().eAllStructuralFeatures@ which means get all the structural features available for the current eClass.
* an _Iterator_ set to @eStructuralFeature@.
** a _Dynamic Mapping If_ with the _Predicate Expression_ equals to @aql:eStructuralFeature.eType.instanceTypeName = 'java.lang.String'@ which means that we just keep the structural features serialized as a String. Notice that in the predicate expression we use the variable @eStructuralFeature@ which was defined as the _Iterator_.
*** in this case we will represent the structural feature with a _Text widget_ for which we set:
**** _Label expression_: @aql:eStructuralFeature.name.toUpperFirst() + ':'@ which means get the name of the structural feature, capitalize the first letter and add @:@ at the end.
**** _Value Expression_: @aql:self.eGet(eStructuralFeature.name)@ which means get the value associated to the given structural feature.

Thanks to this mechanism we defined that all the @String@ elements in our metamodel will be represented with a text field.

Some _Iterable Expression_ may return a result which can change depending on the structure of the model, contrary to the example above where the _Iterable Expression_ @aql:self.eClass().eAllStructuralFeatures@ will only use the structure of the metamodel. If an _Iterable Expression_ leverages the state of the model, it may be required to refresh the user interface when the _Iterable Expression_ is executed, as a result for such situation, you can set the boolean _Force Refresh_ to true on the _Dynamic Mapping For_ to indicate that the presence of dynamic mapping should trigger a full refresh. 

h2(#containers_and_layout). Containers and Layout

Sirius provides a default algorithm to perform an automatic layout of all the controls in a properties view. If the default algorithm does not fit your needs, you can specify some parameters for alternate layouts directly inside the VSM. To do this you must first create a _Container_ which will contains all the widgets to which the layout will apply, and then create and configure the layout to be used by the container to organize its children widgets:

p(#fill_layout). _Fill layout_ can organize elements inside the container either horizontally or vertically (configurable on the _Fill layout_ element).

p(#grid_layout). _Grid layout_ can organize elements using a fixed number of column (configurable on the _Grid layout_ element), which can optionally be made to all have the same width.

h2(#styling). Styling

Styles define the graphical appearance of properties view elements. Sirius supports a rich set of possible styles, including "conditional styles":#conditional_styles which can dynamically change depending on the current state of the underlying model elements. If no style is defined a default style is applied by Sirius.
It is possible to re-define the default style by creating a style under the properties view element description. 

h3(#widgets_styles). Widgets styles

One of the responsibility of widgets styles is to describe how labels will be formated. The following properties are available :
* _Label Font Name Expression_: Is used to compute the name of the font to use for the label.
* _Label Font Size Expression_ : Indicates the font size to use in points.
* _Label Background Color_: You can specify the background color of the label using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Label Foreground Color_: You can specify the foreground color of the label using "color":#colors sub-elements.
* _Label Font Format_: Is used to specify the font style attributes (Bold and/or Italic and/or Underline and/or Strike through).

!images/label-styles.png(Examples of the style customizations possible on labels)!

h3(#colors). Colors

Whenever you have to specify colors for a style, you can use either one of the pre-defined system colors or one which you have defined yourself in a _Users Color Palette_. See "the general section on colors":../general/Colors.html for more details.

h3(#conditional_styles). Conditional Styles

Conditional styles make it possible to support different graphical aspects for a single properties view element. The actual style used to render an element is determined dynamically depending on the current state of the models elements.

To use conditional styling, you must add one or several conditional styles. Each conditional style is associated to a condition specified as a predicate. If there are conditional styles on a properties view element, their conditions are tested in their order of appearance in the description. The first one for which the condition is true is selected. If none of the conditional styles condition is true, the default style is used instead.

h2(#validation_rules). Validation rules

There are three kind of validation rules that can be specified. The main difference between the various kind of validation rules available is the location of the validation messages (on a page, a group or a widget). All the validation rules can contains audits used to determine if the validation rule has been broken thanks to an @auditExpression@ which should return a boolean indicating if the validation of the rule is a success. The validation rules can also contain fixes in order to fix the issue found. Those validation fixes have a name and a fix expression which will be executed once the end user selects a quick fix. The fix expression does not have to return anything. All of those expressions have access to the variables @self@, the result of the semantic candidate expression of the page or group and @input@ the input of the view.

h3(#page_semantic_validation_rule). Page semantic validation rule

The page semantic validation rule is used to define a validation rule linked to a page.

h3(#group_semantic_validation_rule). Group semantic validation rule

The group semantic validation rule is used to define a validation rule linked to a group.

h3(#group_property_validation_rule). Group property validation rule

The group property validation rule is used to define a validation rule linked to a specific widget.

h2(#extensibility_features). Extensibility Features

Sirius has specific support for extending and overriding properties view descriptions without modifying the original one. The purpose is to be able to reuse or modify a part of a properties view. Its exits two different concepts to customize a properties view description: the "extension":#extends and the "overriding":#overrides. 

Note that both mechanisms can be used to customize properties view descriptions which are defined in other projects. To allow references from you VSM to elements defined in other modelers, you must first _load_ them in your VSM editor, or you will not see the elements you need as targets for extension/overriding. To load an external VSM, right-click anywhere inside the VSM editor, and select _Load Resource..._. A dialog will appear asking for the URI of the model to load (the @.odesign@ file you want to refer to). Several forms of URIs are possible:
* If you don't have the customized plug-in in your workspace, you must currently enter the URI manually, using the syntax @platform:/plugin/<projectName>/<path>/<to>/<example>.odesign@, for example @platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.emf.ecoretools.design/description/ecore.odesign@.
* If the VSM you want to extend is already present in your development workspace, you can use the _Browse Workspace..._ button to select it.

Note that in the later case (VSM selected from the workspace), if you want to test your modeler directly from your development environment, in your test session make sure to select the extended VSM *from the workspace*, as this is the one your own VSM refers to, and not the one which may also be avaible from your plug-ins. In the viewpoint selection dialog, the version from the workspace will have a small folder decorator in addition to the normal viewpoint icon. Once everything is deployed as plug-ins, which is the nominal case for end-users, this distinction disappears and everything should work fine.

Note also that if you define in your project _A_ customizations for properties views defintions defined in another project _B_, you should make sure to declare the dependency in project _A_'s @MANIFEST.MF@, otherwise it will be possible for users to install _A_ without having _B_ available, which will prevent _A_ from working correctly.  

h3(#extends). Extends

A "page":#pages can extend another page defined somewhere else (in another "category":#categories or in another properties view description). This mechanism is used to _specialize_ (modify or re-use) an existing page. This feature is available for the "pages":#pages, the "groups":#groups, the "containers":#containers_and_layout, the "dynamic mappings":#dynamic_mappings and the "widgets":#widgets.

The @Extend@ tab is used to specify:

p(#extends). *Extends.* Is used to specify the inherited element thanks to a combo box it is possible to select an existing element. In the tree editor, the inheritance is visible as the element is named as following : _Page A_ *extends* _Page B_. Pay attention, the current specification editor allows to select the currently defined element, this will lead to an infinite loop at runtime. 
By default, the values of the @General@ tab fields are set with the values coming from the extended element if these fields are not set in the extending element. If one of these attributes is edited in the extending element, then it *overrides* the inherited value. The same behavior is applied for mono valued containment elements. For example, if a _Group A_ defines a _Style A_ and extends a _Group B_ with a _Style B_, the style used to render the _Group A_ is the one defined under the _Group A_, i.e _Style A_ and not the one of the _Group B_.
If the specifier defines in the extending page @General@ tab:
* @Label Expression@, @Domain Class@, @Semantic Candidate Expression@ or @Precondition Expression@, these values will *override* the values defined in the extended description. It is worth noting that the expressions are evaluated in the context of the currently extending element, exactly as if you have defined the expressions from the @General@ tab. 
* @Groups@ will *be aggregated* to the groups defined by the referenced @Page@. 
* @Page Validations@  will *be aggregated* to the validations defined by the referenced @Page Description@.
* In the case of a containment, such as a @Text@ contained by a @Group@, the contained elements are inherited by the extending description.

p(#filters). *Filter Expressions.* Different filters exist depending on the element kind. These filters are used to *filter* which inherited elements are visible. The _Filter expression_ is evaluated in the context of the semantic element and should return a boolean: true, the inherited element is visible, false it is filtered.
If the expression is not specified, all the inherited elements will be visible.
For each _Filter expression_, a variable is available which represents the element which could be filtered. It is possible to filter all the inherited elements by just returning @false@ all the time. In this case, the elements defined under the current description *overrides* the elements defined in the extended description.
For example if a _Page A_ extends another _Page B_, the @Extends@ tab allows to define:
* The @Filter Groups Expression@ is used to *filter* which inherited groups are visible under the page. The @groupDescription@ variable can be used to check if a group must be filtered or not. 
* The @Filter Validation Rules Expression@ is used to *filter* which inherited validation rules are used under the page. The @validationRuleDescription@ variable can be used to check if a rule must be filtered or not.

Following some examples of the extension mechanism usage are detailed:
* *Reuse widgets*: In this example we want to specify the properties view of a Class and an interface both are defining a name attribute. A _Class Name_ text widget is defined to represent the _Name_ attribute of a _Class_ in the properties view. This widget defines in the _General_ tab:
** The _Label Expression_ equals to @Name:@,
** The _Help Expression_ equals to @The name of the element@,
** The _Value Expression_ equals to @aql:self.name@,
** The change value operation sets the @name@ feature with the new entered value.

!images/reuse-widget-general-tab.png(Example of the inherited text widget definition)! 

An interface has also a _Name_ attribute which must be shown in its properties view, then to define the properties of the interface, we just create a new text widget which extends the @Class Name Widget@.
No other fields and no change value operation need to be set for the @Interface Name Widget@, all the values will be inherited from the @Class Name Widget@.

!images/reuse-widget-extends-tab.png(Example of the extension definition)! 
 
!images/reuse-widget-general2-tab.png(Example of the reuse of a widget definition)! 

* *Reuse pages*: Another usage of the extension mechanism is with combination of "the dialogs and the wizards":../general/Model_Operations.html#dialogandwizard. The purpose is to provide the edition of the properties element from a dialog, the same properties should be available in the dialog and in the properties view. A a property view is defined for all the elements of a metamodel. Then a new tool is defined which opens a dialog when a node mapping is double-clicked from a diagram. This dialog shows the same properties than the ones represented when the element is selected from the diagram. To do this, the dialog defines a page which extends the one defined in the properties view definition.

!images/reuse-page.png(Example of the reuse of a page definition in a dialog)!

* *Customize default rules*: A final example of the extension mechanism is to customize the "default rules":#default_rules provided by Sirius. For this use case, the purpose is to override the content of the default rules in order to rename the tab label from _Main_ to _General_. It is possible to extends the default rules thanks to the _New Properties> Extend Default Properties View_ menu available from the top-level element of the VSM model. Automatically, this creates a new page which extends the default rules. It is then possible to override the _Label Expression_ of the default rules page to set the expected label _General_ instead of the default one which is _Main_

!images/customize-default-rules-extends.png(Example of the extension of default rules)!

!images/customize-default-rules-general.png(Example of the customization of default rules)! 
 
h3(#overrides). Overrides

The main difference between the "extend":#extends mechanism and the "overrides":#overrides mechanism is that the extend mechanism allows to reuse some parts of a properties view specification on another hand the "override":#overrides mechanism allows to replace some parts of a properties view specification.
This means that when you define an override description it will completely replace the referenced description, this must be used when it is not possible for the specifier to modify the original description.

It is possible to create an override element under a "category":#categories from the _New Override_ menu.

A page override can extend another page defined somewhere else (in another "category":#categories or in another properties view description). This mechanism is used to _replace_ an existing page. It is possible to define :
* page override: a _Page Override_ is a page and so defines the same features as a "page":#pages, 
* group override: a _Group Override_ is a group and so defines the same features as a "group":#groups, 
* container override: a _Container Override_ is a container and so defines the same features as a "container":#containers_and_layout, 
* dynamic mapping override: a _Dynamic Mapping Override_ is a dynamic mapping and so defines the same features as a "dynamic mapping":#dynamic_mappings,
* widget override: a _Widget Override_ is a widget and so defines the same features as a "widget":#widgets.

The @Override@ tab is used to specify:

p(#override). *Override.* Is used to specify the overridden element thanks to a combo box it is possible to select an existing element. In the tree editor, the inheritance is visible as the element is named as following : _Page A_ *extends* _Page B_. Pay attention, the current specification editor allows to select the currently defined element, this will lead to an infinite loop at runtime. 
By default, the values of the @General@ tab fields are set with the values coming from the overridden element if these fields are not set in the extending element. If one of these attributes is edited in the extending element, then it *overrides* the inherited value. The same behavior is applied for mono valued containment elements. For example, if a _Group A_ defines a _Style A_ and extends a _Group B_ with a _Style B_, the style used to render the _Group A_ is the one defined under the _Group A_, i.e _Style A_ and not the one of the _Group B_.
If the specifier defines in the extending page @General@ tab:
* @Label Expression@, @Domain Class@, @Semantic Candidate Expression@ or @Precondition Expression@, these values will *override* the values defined in the extended description. It is worth noting that the expressions are evaluated in the context of the currently extending element, exactly as if you have defined the expressions from the @General@ tab. 
* @Groups@ will *be aggregated* to the groups defined by the referenced @Page@. 
* @Page Validations@  will *be aggregated* to the validations defined by the referenced @Page Description@.
* In the case of a containment, such as a @Text@ contained by a @Group@, the contained elements are inherited by the extending description.

p(#filters). *Filter Expressions.* Different filters exist depending on the element kind. These filters are used to *filter* which inherited elements are visible. The _Filter expression_ is evaluated in the context of the semantic element and should return a boolean: true, the inherited element is visible, false it is filtered.
If the expression is not specified, all the inherited elements will be visible.
For each _Filter expression_, a variable is available which represents the element which could be filtered. It is possible to filter all the inherited elements by just returning @false@ all the time. In this case, the elements defined under the current description *overrides* the elements defined in the extended description.
For example if a _Page A_ extends another _Page B_, the @Extends@ tab allows to define:
* The @Filter Groups Expression@ is used to *filter* which inherited groups are visible under the page. The @groupDescription@ variable can be used to check if a group must be filtered or not. 
* The @Filter Validation Rules Expression@ is used to *filter* which inherited validation rules are used under the page. The @validationRuleDescription@ variable can be used to check if a rule must be filtered or not.

If an element is overridden by many override definitions, the first encountered in the specification is applied.

h2(#extension_points). Extension Points

h3(#advanced_custom_widgets_extension_points). Extension Points for Advanced Custom Widgets

Integrating and advanced custom widget implementation requires extending several extension points:
* @org.eclipse.emf.edit.childCreationExtenders@: When generating the metamodel for the custom configuration DSL of your widget, make sure EMF's @childCreationExtenders@ mechanism is properly configured so that the Sirus VSM editor will see your custom widget type and allow them to be created in the _New_ context menu.
* @org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core.descriptionConverter@: This extension point allows you to participate in the conversion of the Sirius-side VSM model into the EEF DSL. With this mechanism, you can translate for the EEF runtime new elements that you have contributed in the Sirius Properties DSL.
* @org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core.descriptionLinkResolver@: This extension point may be needed in complement to the @descriptionConverter@ if some post-transformation step is needed on your transformed model to perform global link resolution.
* @org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core..descriptionPreprocessor@: This extension point allows you to participate in the preprocessing of the Sirius-side VSM model with "extensibility features":#extensibility_features into a _flatten_ Sirius-side VSM model. 
Please refer to the documentation for each of these for more details. And "the reference documentation":../../developer/extensions-properties_provide_custom_widget_advanced.html for the full details on how to actually implement your own advanced custom widgets.

h3(#tab_filtering). Tab Filtering

The EEF runtime used internally by Sirius to render the properties views has programmatic support for filtering property tabs that you may want to hide in your context. For example you may want to filter out some legacy tabs defined statically if you provide alternative versions defined dynamically in Sirius.

This feature is not currently exposed via the Sirius VSMs, but you can still use it by implementing the @org.eclipse.eef.properties.ui.api.IEEFTabDescriptorFilter@ interface, and registering your implementation in the @org.eclipse.eef.properties.ui.eefTabDescriptorFilter@ extension point defined in EEF.

The interface defines a single method @boolean filter(IEEFTabDescriptor tabDescriptor)@ which will be called for each candidate tab to display. If at least one of the @IEEFTabDescriptorFilter@ registered indicates that the tab should be filtered, it will not be displayed.

Please refer to the EEF extension point documentation for more details.
