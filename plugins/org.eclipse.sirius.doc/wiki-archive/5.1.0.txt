Sirius 5.1.0's main theme is stabilization of the features introduced in version 5.0, in particular the new aird file editor (which also gains support for extensibility). It also includes several ergonomic enhancements for diagrams (mostly about shape alignment and fine control of layout), and infrastructure work which should allow future versions to provide better scalability for projects with many representations.
