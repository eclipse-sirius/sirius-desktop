Sirius 6.0.0 is a major release and part of Eclipse Photon. See [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.sirius/releases/6.0.0 the release record] for an overview of the major features and important bug fixes.

Note that two new optional features introduced in this version are considered experimental at the moment:
* The ''Sirius ELK Integration'' feature (<code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.elk.feature</code>).
* The ''Sirius Support for Modeling Workflows'' feature (<code>org.eclipse.sirius.workflow.feature</code>). ''Note'': the version of this feature in Sirius 6.0.0 is broken under Windows. This will be fixed in 6.0.1.

Adopters are welcome to test them and [http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=262 feedback] is very welcome, but they should not be used on production modelers at the moment.
