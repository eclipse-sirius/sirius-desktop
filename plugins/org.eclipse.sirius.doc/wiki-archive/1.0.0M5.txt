== New & Noteworthy ==

Apart from a few bug fixes related to tables, most of the changes in this release only impact the internal structure of the code.
* [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=423037 #423037] is the first phase of a larger-scale work to separate the code implementing the "diagrams" dialect from the Sirius core. It involved moving diagram-related types from the metamodel into their own Ecore packages. Existing models will be transparently migrated when loaded and continue to work as before. If you have Java code which referenced the corresponding types, you will need to make some adjustments; see [http://eclipse.org/sirius/doc/Release%20Notes.html#sirius1.0M5 the release notes] for details.
* [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=423051 #423051] moved some generic code out of the main Sirius plug-ins and into [[Sirius/Library_Extensions|library extensions]], which are separate plug-ins. If you had Java code which used the corresponding types, you will need to update it by possibly adding new dependencies (to the library extensions) and changing the <code>import</code> declarations in your code; see [http://eclipse.org/sirius/doc/Release%20Notes.html#sirius1.0M5 the release notes] for details.
